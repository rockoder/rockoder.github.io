## 2026-02-01 - [Automated Technical Content Extraction from Hacker News]
**Learning:** Automated curation of high-quality technical content from Hacker News requires a multi-layered extraction strategy. `trafilatura` is superior for isolating "clean" article bodies from diverse domains, while internal HN posts (Ask/Show HN) must be treated as first-party content by targeting the `toptext` container. Hierarchical comment extraction is most robust when using the specific `indent` attribute now present in HN's markup, falling back to legacy image-width heuristics only when necessary.
**Implication:** Future curation scripts should prioritize data attributes over structural position to maintain resilience against minor markup changes, and use specialized NLP/scraping libraries like `trafilatura` to ensure expert-level content density without UI clutter.

## 2026-02-12 - The Cost of Adversarial Silence
**Learning:** In highly adversarial environments (cloud fraud, state-level surveillance), security is often achieved through "silent heuristics" that prioritize platform safety over user observability. This creates a fundamental gaslighting effect where the system's external state (Dashboard "Online") decouples from its internal reality (process killed by fraud model), leaving legitimate experts unable to debug structural failures.
**Implication:** When analyzing system reliability, we must distinguish between "accidental downtime" and "intentional silence." The latter is a policy choice that requires a different mental model of trust—one where the user acknowledges they are a potential adversary to the infrastructure they pay for.
