## 2026-02-01 - [Automated Technical Content Extraction from Hacker News]
**Learning:** Automated curation of high-quality technical content from Hacker News requires a multi-layered extraction strategy. `trafilatura` is superior for isolating "clean" article bodies from diverse domains, while internal HN posts (Ask/Show HN) must be treated as first-party content by targeting the `toptext` container. Hierarchical comment extraction is most robust when using the specific `indent` attribute now present in HN's markup, falling back to legacy image-width heuristics only when necessary.
**Implication:** Future curation scripts should prioritize data attributes over structural position to maintain resilience against minor markup changes, and use specialized NLP/scraping libraries like `trafilatura` to ensure expert-level content density without UI clutter.

## 2026-02-05 - [The "Vibe-Coding" vs. Senior Judgment Split]
**Learning:** Hacker News discourse around AI coding tools reveals a widening gap between "Capability Enthusiasts" (who see authoring speed as the primary metric) and "Systems Realists" (who see maintenance, liability, and governance as the primary constraints). Disagreements often stem from conflating the cost of *writing* software with the cost of *owning* it.
**Implication:** Technical writing for this audience must bridge this gap by explicitly acknowledging the systems-level "second S" (Service/Responsibility) rather than just arguing about the "first S" (Software/Authoring).
