## 2026-02-01 - [Automated Technical Content Extraction from Hacker News]
**Learning:** Automated curation of high-quality technical content from Hacker News requires a multi-layered extraction strategy. `trafilatura` is superior for isolating "clean" article bodies from diverse domains, while internal HN posts (Ask/Show HN) must be treated as first-party content by targeting the `toptext` container. Hierarchical comment extraction is most robust when using the specific `indent` attribute now present in HN's markup, falling back to legacy image-width heuristics only when necessary.
**Implication:** Future curation scripts should prioritize data attributes over structural position to maintain resilience against minor markup changes, and use specialized NLP/scraping libraries like `trafilatura` to ensure expert-level content density without UI clutter.

## 2026-02-06 – The Verification Bottleneck and Hostile Web
**Learning:** The asymmetric cost of verification is the primary friction point in the transition to AI-augmented engineering. High-recall tools (LLMs) break the social contract of trust in open-source security by drowning maintainers in "correct-looking slop." Simultaneously, the "Hostile Web" transition shows that as data extraction becomes more valuable, platforms will aggressively probe the client's local state, ending the era of the browser as a neutral user agent.
**Implication:** Future writing should focus less on the *discovery* power of AI and more on the *filtering* and *governance* models required to handle its output. Editorial emphasis must shift toward "Local-First" and "Verified-Only" architectures as a defense against both slop and client-side interrogation.
