## 2026-02-01 - [Automated Technical Content Extraction from Hacker News]
**Learning:** Automated curation of high-quality technical content from Hacker News requires a multi-layered extraction strategy. `trafilatura` is superior for isolating "clean" article bodies from diverse domains, while internal HN posts (Ask/Show HN) must be treated as first-party content by targeting the `toptext` container. Hierarchical comment extraction is most robust when using the specific `indent` attribute now present in HN's markup, falling back to legacy image-width heuristics only when necessary.
**Implication:** Future curation scripts should prioritize data attributes over structural position to maintain resilience against minor markup changes, and use specialized NLP/scraping libraries like `trafilatura` to ensure expert-level content density without UI clutter.

## 2026-02-02 – [The Cognitive Budget of Distributed Reasoning]
**Learning:** The "agent swarm" narrative is collapsing under the weight of the "Sequential Penalty"—a 40-70% accuracy drop when continuous reasoning is fragmented across multiple lossy natural language hops. High comment density on "Science of Scaling" posts indicates that senior engineers are shifting from "how to build" to "how to verify," as the coordination tax of multi-agent systems becomes the primary bottleneck in production.
**Implication:** Future essays must treat AI orchestration as a distributed systems problem rather than a linguistic one. We should prioritize models that focus on deterministic topology design, "Cognitive Budgeting," and specialized validation bottlenecks over general-purpose model intelligence.
