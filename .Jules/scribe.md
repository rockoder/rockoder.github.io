## 2026-02-01 - [Automated Technical Content Extraction from Hacker News]
**Learning:** Automated curation of high-quality technical content from Hacker News requires a multi-layered extraction strategy. `trafilatura` is superior for isolating "clean" article bodies from diverse domains, while internal HN posts (Ask/Show HN) must be treated as first-party content by targeting the `toptext` container. Hierarchical comment extraction is most robust when using the specific `indent` attribute now present in HN's markup, falling back to legacy image-width heuristics only when necessary.
**Implication:** Future curation scripts should prioritize data attributes over structural position to maintain resilience against minor markup changes, and use specialized NLP/scraping libraries like `trafilatura` to ensure expert-level content density without UI clutter.

## 2026-02-04 - [Protocol Economics and Regulatory Backpressure]
**Learning:** High-signal discourse often emerges from the gap between a technical standard (like MCP) and its ecosystem implementation. The real "value" of a post isn't the technical explanation, but the architectural implication of that standard on existing moats. Similarly, regulatory failures (GDPR) are rarely about ethics and almost always about resource allocation and the absence of system-level feedback loops (backpressure).
**Implication:** Shift the writing focus from "What happened" to "What is the new incentive structure." Use system-thinking models (queuing theory, protocol decoupling, fiduciary duty) to frame current events as predictable outcomes of underlying constraints.
