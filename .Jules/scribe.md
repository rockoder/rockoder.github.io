## 2026-01-26 – The Velocity-Theory Disconnect
**Learning:** Hacker News discourse on AI coding has shifted from "can it code?" to "how fast can it code?". This reveals a deep architectural blind spot regarding Peter Naur's "Programming as Theory Building" model. Experts and managers are talking past each other because they disagree on whether software is a *product* (artifact) or a *process* (mental model).
**Implication:** Future essays should focus on the hidden costs of "artifact-only" development. Writing should consistently challenge the "throughput" metric by highlighting the fragility of systems where no human holds the complete "theory."

## 2026-01-26 – The Physical Proximity Arbitrage
**Learning:** There is a recurring pattern where "obsolete" technologies (phone wires, in-process DBs) outperform "modern" stacks by simply removing protocol boundaries. The industry has habituated to a high "abstraction penalty," treating network latency as a fixed cost of doing business.
**Implication:** Look for other areas where "removing layers" is a contrarian path to performance. High-signal writing should surface the "Physics of Latency" as a primary architectural constraint that scale-out models often ignore.

## 2026-01-26 – Regulatory Malicious Compliance
**Learning:** Interoperability discourse often misses the "weaponization of UX." Legal wins (DMA) are being neutralized by tactical friction. The battlefield has moved from data formats to the "pixel-level" experience.
**Implication:** Shift the lens from "policy" to "product strategy" when discussing regulation. High-signal analysis must address how incumbents use the complexity of compliance to build new, invisible moats.
