## 2026-02-01 - [Automated Technical Content Extraction from Hacker News]
**Learning:** Automated curation of high-quality technical content from Hacker News requires a multi-layered extraction strategy. `trafilatura` is superior for isolating "clean" article bodies from diverse domains, while internal HN posts (Ask/Show HN) must be treated as first-party content by targeting the `toptext` container. Hierarchical comment extraction is most robust when using the specific `indent` attribute now present in HN's markup, falling back to legacy image-width heuristics only when necessary.
**Implication:** Future curation scripts should prioritize data attributes over structural position to maintain resilience against minor markup changes, and use specialized NLP/scraping libraries like `trafilatura` to ensure expert-level content density without UI clutter.

## 2026-02-25 – The Framework Liquefaction and the Triage of Ethics
**Learning:** When the cost of re-implementing a complex API surface drops towards zero, the value of a software platform shifts from its code to its test suite and specification. In parallel, unilateral ethical commitments in high-speed, high-stakes competition are structurally unstable; they tend to evolve into 'transparency triage' where the actor moves from gatekeeping to witnessing.
**Implication:** Future writing should prioritize identifying 'specification-rich' environments where implementation is becoming a commodity, and describing the structural pressures that force companies to transition from idealistic control to pragmatic transparency.
