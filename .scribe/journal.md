## 2026-02-17 – The Decoupling of Generation and Verification Costs

Learning: The core organizational shift driven by AI is not the speed of "production," but the radical decoupling of the cost to generate an artifact from the cost to verify its correctness. Traditional engineering systems relied on a roughly 1:1 ratio between these costs to maintain safety and visibility. When the ratio shifts to 1:10 or 1:100, the system enters a state of "Judgment Debt," where the volume of unverified output exceeds the cognitive capacity of the reviewers.

Implication: Future analysis must prioritize the "Verification Layer" of the organization. Impact will increasingly be measured not by what an engineer can generate, but by the "trust radius" of their judgment—their ability to guarantee the safety of systems they did not personally construct.
