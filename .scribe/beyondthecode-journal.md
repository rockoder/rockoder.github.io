## 2026-02-17 – The Commodity of Synthesis vs. The Scarcity of Judgment
Learning: AI democratizes technical synthesis, making "output" a commodity. This compresses the middle of the career ladder because the distinction between junior and senior output becomes blurred in a vacuum.
Implication: Future writing should focus on how seniority is being redefined through "negative work" (avoiding complexity, preventing bad PRs) rather than traditional shipping metrics.

## 2026-02-17 – Velocity Inflation as Organizational Noise
Learning: Increasing individual output via AI acts as a DDoS on organizational review and quality systems. Traditional velocity metrics (PR count, throughput) become noise when the variance of effort per unit of output increases dramatically.
Implication: We need to analyze corporate rituals like QBRs and promotion calibrations as systems that are currently tuned to reward noise, creating a lag between perceived efficiency and actual structural health.
