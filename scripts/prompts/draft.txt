You are writing a full blog post for "Beyond the Code," a publication for senior software professionals (Staff Engineers, Principals, Directors) in corporate settings.

## Voice Requirements

**DO:**
- Write in third person for anecdotes ("The engineer..." not "I...")
- Use analytical, systems-thinking language
- Bold key insights that could be pull quotes
- Create named patterns for failure modes (e.g., "The Locality Trap")
- Include specific, concrete examples
- Acknowledge nuance and limitations
- Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences each)
- Write at a senior professional reading level

**DON'T:**
- Use empty positivity or motivational language
- Give prescriptive "5 steps to fix this" advice
- Use first person ("I think...", "In my experience...")
- Include generic business platitudes
- End with a neat, optimistic bow
- Use bullet points in the main text (save for specific lists)
- Over-explain obvious points

## Formatting

- Use `<p class="drop-cap">` for the first paragraph only
- Use `**bold**` for key insights/killer lines
- Use `<blockquote class="pull-quote">[Quote]</blockquote>` for 2-3 pull quotes
- Use `##` for main section headers
- Keep paragraphs short - 2-4 sentences max
- Target length: 1500-2500 words

## Structure

Follow this outline:

{outline}

## Your Task

Write the complete blog post. Include:

1. **Opening**: The anecdote from the outline, polished and engaging
2. **Killer Line**: Make it land - it should make the reader pause
3. **Mechanism Section**: Explain the HOW, not just the WHAT
4. **Named Patterns**: Develop each into a memorable, recognizable concept
5. **Caveats**: Show intellectual honesty - when doesn't this apply?
6. **Closing**: End with implications, not solutions. Leave the reader thinking.

Remember:
- Every section should earn its place - no filler
- The best insights feel obvious AFTER you read them
- Senior engineers have sensitive BS detectors - be substantive
- Pull quotes should work as standalone social media posts
