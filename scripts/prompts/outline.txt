You are creating an outline for "Beyond the Code," a blog that explores non-technical topics relevant to senior software professionals (Staff Engineers, Principals, Directors) in corporate settings.

## Voice Profile

The writing style is:
- **Analytical and systems-thinking oriented**: Treat organizations as systems with emergent behaviors
- **Contrarian but substantive**: Challenge conventional wisdom, but with evidence and reasoning
- **Third-person anecdotal openings**: Start with "The engineer..." or "The manager..." not "I" or "You"
- **Named patterns**: Create memorable names for failure modes and organizational dynamics
- **Pull quotes**: Include 2-3 quotable insights that could stand alone
- **Nuanced**: Always include a "Where this breaks" or caveats section
- **No empty positivity**: Avoid inspirational fluff, focus on mechanisms and implications

## Structure Pattern

Every Beyond the Code post follows this structure:

1. **HOOK** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Third-person anecdote that grounds the topic in a specific, relatable scenario
   - Example: "The engineer shipped seven features in a single sprint..."

2. **KILLER LINE** (1 sentence, bolded)
   - A standalone insight that captures the core contrarian take
   - Example: "**Code has become cheaper to produce than to perceive.**"

3. **THE MECHANISM** (2-4 paragraphs)
   - Explain HOW the phenomenon works, not just THAT it exists
   - Use systems thinking: feedback loops, incentives, information flows
   - Be specific about cause and effect

4. **WHY ORGANIZATIONS CAN'T SEE IT** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Explain the structural/measurement blindness
   - What metrics or processes hide this reality?
   - Why do well-intentioned people perpetuate it?

5. **NAMED FAILURE MODES** (2-3 subsections)
   - Give memorable names to specific manifestations
   - Example: "The Locality Trap", "The Reviewer's Dilemma", "The Documentation Asymmetry"
   - Each should be concrete and actionable to recognize

6. **CAVEATS / WHERE THIS BREAKS** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Intellectual honesty about limitations
   - When does the contrarian take NOT apply?
   - What assumptions is this built on?

7. **IMPLICATIONS** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - What does this mean for the reader's work or career?
   - Not prescriptive "5 steps to fix this" - more observational
   - End with something that lingers, not a neat bow

## Your Task

Create a detailed outline for a post about:

**TOPIC**: {topic}

**CONTRARIAN ANGLE**: {contrarian_angle}

**SOURCE CONTEXT**: {sources}

**TIMELINESS**: {timeliness}

Generate an outline with:
1. A compelling third-person opening anecdote (draft the actual sentences)
2. A killer line that captures the core insight
3. Section headers and 2-3 bullet points per section
4. 2-3 named patterns/failure modes with working names
5. Specific pull quote candidates (the quotable insights)
6. The caveats section topics

Format your response as:

```
## Opening Anecdote
[Draft the actual opening paragraph]

## Killer Line
**[The bolded insight]**

## Sections

### Section 1: [Title]
- Point 1
- Point 2
- Point 3

### Section 2: [Title]
...

## Named Patterns
1. [Pattern Name]: [Brief description]
2. [Pattern Name]: [Brief description]

## Pull Quote Candidates
1. "[Quote]"
2. "[Quote]"

## Caveats to Address
- Caveat 1
- Caveat 2
```
