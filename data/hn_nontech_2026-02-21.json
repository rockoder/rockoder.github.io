      "post_text": "13 years ago, we launched Watsi.org with a Show HN [1].<p>For nearly a year, this community drove so much traffic that we couldn’t list patients fast enough. Then pg saw us on HN, wrote us our first big check, and accepted us as the first YC nonprofit (W13). The next few years were a whirlwind.<p>I was a young, naive founder with just enough experience to know I wanted Watsi to be more efficient, transparent, and innovative than most nonprofits. We spent 24&#x2F;7 talking to users and coding. We did things that don’t scale. We tried our best to be walking, talking pg essays.<p>Over the years we learned that product&#x2F;market fit is different for nonprofits. Not many people wake up and think, &quot;I&#x27;d love to donate to a nonprofit today&quot; with the same oomph that they think, &quot;I&#x27;d love a coffee&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;d like to make more money.&quot;<p>No matter how much effort we put into fundraising, donations grew linearly, while requests for care grew exponentially. I felt caught in the middle. After investing everything I had, I eventually burned out and transitioned to the board.<p>I made a classic founder mistake and intertwined my self-worth with Watsi&#x27;s success. I believed that if I could somehow help every patient, I was a good person, but if I let down some patients, which became inevitable, I was a bad person.<p>This was exacerbated by seeing our for-profit YC batch mates raise massive rounds. I felt like a failure for not scaling Watsi faster, but eventually we accepted reality and set Watsi on more of a slow, steady, and sustainable trajectory.<p>Now that I have perspective, I&#x27;m incredibly proud of what the org has accomplished and grateful to everyone who has done a tour of duty to support us. Watsi donors have donated over $20M to fund 33,241 surgeries, and we have a good shot of helping patients for a long time to come.<p>In a world of fast growth and fast crashes, here&#x27;s a huge thank you to the HN users who have stuck by Watsi, or any other important cause, even when it&#x27;s not on the front page. I believe it embodies the best of humanity. Thanks HN!<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4424081\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4424081</a>",

I have a single OVH instance where I ma playing with Openclaw, but that was because I was having issues with Hetzner that day on their new instance page (was fixed the next day)\nI use Bunny for my CDN, I just wish they have the capabilityt to route IPv4 and IPv6 traffic to IPv6 only origins. If your origin doesn't have IPv4, it wont route IPv4 to an IPv6 origin. Something Cloudflare could do. Still a shame its not a high priority.\nFor Domains, I am still on porkbun, but i have like 20 domains, and moving them to EU registrars would be pricey. I will do it, just not looking forward to it. Also there are few registrars tht handle all the TLDs i have, nothing like Porkbun. I use dot.bs to optimize my registrars and keep track of them.\nI self-host a lot, but I haven't done github. I have a Forgejo instance with working CI/CD, but there are some painpoints mirroring 100s of repos and updating PATs. Also I minimize how much critical infra I host. I do it as my day job. Don't want to do it so much at home, and I still do some between NAS and self-hosted services I do run.\nI do plan to try out Hanko and Nebius, those sound good. and Hit up scaleway to see if there is stuff I want to use there.

However, I've realized you can stay sovereign and independent in any jurisdiction (not just Europe) just by simplifying your stack and running a few baremetal servers in-house.\nJust buy a few Mac Studios and run them in-house with power supply backup and networking redundancy and you're good to go to serve more than 10k - 100k requests/second which is good enough to serve a million customers. You don't need VMs: a single Mac Studio gets you 2–4x the power of m7i.2xlarge on AWS, and pays for itself within a few months of AWS bills. You can do local AI inference and get Claude Opus-level performance (Kimi K2.5) over a cluster of Mac Studios with Exo.Labs (an unofficial Apple partner). You get free S3-compatible object storage with zero ongoing storage costs with MinIO (yes it's redundant even if you lose a server, and your hosting provider can't hold your data hostage by charging for egress). Postgres runs like a beast and is incredibly easy to setup - you get zero latency DB because it runs on the same machine, has access to lots of RAM and you're not paying per-GB or per-core. Managed databases are a scam. You don't need an Auth provider, just do passkeys yourself. And the great thing about Apple Silicon hardware is that it is amazingly quiet, reliable, and efficient - you can do thing like run headless browsers 3x faster and cheaper than on standard server hardware because of the unified memory and GPU acceleration, so you're not paying for CI/CD compute by-the-minute or headless browsers either.\nThis entire stack could give you computing power equivalent to a 25k euro/month AWS bill for the cost of electricity (same electricity cost as running a few fridges 24/7) plus about 50k euros one-time to set it up (about 4 Mac Studios). And yes, it's redundant, scalable, and even faster (in terms of per-request latency) than standard AWS/GCP cloud bloat. Not only is it cheaper and you own everything, but your app will work faster because all services are local (DB, Redis cache, SSD, etc.) without any VM overhead, shared cores, or noisy neighbours.",

Everything else is cattle, you can shut down or spin up new instances and the load balancer redirects requests with no impact. Making Postgres redundant is a matter of careful configuration with PGBouncer + HAProxy + Patroni. However for a long time we had a much simpler setup: just restore a new database from backup on a new machine if the main one failed (one-time simple script run manually - not automatic, means a little bit of downtime if there's a failure, but it worked). Or you could use CockroachDB. Making disk redundant: just use MinIO for S3-like disk (that's also where DB backups are stored). You can lose up to 2 out 4 of your servers and you lose nothing.\nWith this setup if 1 or 2 Mac Studios fail (or need to be restarted for updates) everything just keeps running smoothly with no customer impact.

Essentially, I wanted HN to feel like a first-class citizen on macOS, not a website I visit.<p>What it does:<p>- Split-view layout — stories in a sidebar on the left, articles and comments on the right, using the standard macOS NavigationSplitView pattern.<p>- Built-in ad blocking — a precompiled WKContentRuleList blocks 14 major ad networks (DoubleClick, Google Syndication, Criteo, Taboola, Outbrain, Amazon ads, etc.) right in the WebKit layer. No extensions needed. Toggleable in settings.<p>- Pop-up blocking — kills window.open() calls. Also toggleable.<p>- HN account login — full authentication flow (login, account creation, password reset). Session is stored in the macOS Keychain, and cookies are injected into the WebView so you can upvote, comment, and submit stories while staying logged in.<p>- Bookmarks — save stories locally for offline access. Persisted with Codable serialization, searchable and filterable independently.<p>- Search and filtering — powered by the Algolia HN API. Filter by content type (All, Ask, Show, Jobs, Comments), date range (Today, Past Week, Past Month, All Time), and sort by hot or recent.<p>- Scroll progress indicator — a small orange bar at the top tracks your reading progress via JavaScript-to-native messaging.<p>- Auto-updates via Sparkle with EdDSA-signed updates served from GitHub Pages.<p>- Dark mode — respects system appearance with CSS and meta tag injection.<p>Tech details for the curious:<p>The whole app is ~2,050 lines of Swift across 16 files. It uses the modern @Observable macro (not the old ObservableObject&#x2F;Published pattern), structured concurrency with async&#x2F;await and withThrowingTaskGroup for concurrent batch fetching, and SwiftUI throughout — no UIKit&#x2F;AppKit bridges except for the WKWebView wrapper via NSViewRepresentable.<p>Two APIs power the data: the official HN Firebase API for individual item&#x2F;user fetches, and the Algolia Search API for feeds, filtering, and search. The Algolia API is surprisingly powerful for this — it lets you do date-range filtering, pagination, and full-text search that the Firebase API doesn&#x27;t support.<p>CI&#x2F;CD:<p>The release pipeline is a single GitHub Actions workflow (467 lines) that handles the full macOS distribution story: build and archive, code sign with Developer ID, notarize with Apple (with a 5-retry staple loop for ticket propagation delays), create a custom DMG with AppleScript-driven icon positioning, sign and notarize the DMG, generate an EdDSA Sparkle signature, create a GitHub Release, and deploy an updated appcast.xml to GitHub Pages.<p>Getting macOS code signing and notarization working in CI was honestly the hardest part of this project. If anyone is distributing a macOS app outside the App Store via GitHub Actions, I&#x27;m happy to answer questions — the workflow is fully open source.<p>The entire project is MIT licensed. PRs and issues welcome: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IronsideXXVI&#x2F;Hacker-News\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IronsideXXVI&#x2F;Hacker-News</a><p>I&#x27;d love feedback — especially on features you&#x27;d want to see.

And for a while, that's what it was. The disillusionment isn't really about AI or crypto or whatever the current hype cycle is. It's that the job has slowly drifted from \"engineer solving problems\" to \"employee managing process.\" You spend your morning in standups, your afternoon fighting with CI pipelines someone else configured, and your evening wondering what you actually built.\nThe people in this thread who say \"just get perspective, you could be loading trucks\" aren't wrong exactly, but they're answering a different question. Nobody here is saying the pay is bad or the chairs are uncomfortable. They're saying the work feels hollow. Those are different problems, and \"be grateful\" has never been a lasting fix for the second one.\nWhat I've noticed — both in myself and in people around me — is that the ones who stay engaged tend to have found a way to shrink their world back down. Fewer layers between them and the user. Fewer abstractions between them and the machine.

          "top": "Imposter syndrome is a thinking trap.  A couple of things you can do to help:\nTry to separate out 'ruminating' from 'thinking'.  What's the difference? For our purposes 'thinking' has a fixed outcome and an end point.  Trying to solve a coding problem. Working out how to make dinner. Calculating your taxes. When you reach your goal, you're done and you stop.  'Ruminating' has no end point. There is not end or action associated with it.  The tricky part is that it often masquerades as thinking, so you feel like you're solving a problem.\nFor example, you do a job interview and you go over and over what happened in your mind. \"Maybe I should have answered this differently\". \"Maybe I should've prepared some more of these questions\".  Of course, you can't change what happened in the past. You're just rolling the ideas around in your head and probably making yourself feel worse and worse.  Rumination can be focused on the past, the future or even some hypothetical, imaginary situation (\"What if I lost my job\", \"What if my house burnt down\"). Again, actual preparation (Saving an emergency fund. Getting insurance) has an action associated, but rumination never ends, it just keeps going around in your head.\nThe other thing is to keep an accurate record of your performance. This will be different for everyone, and varies a lot depending on the job.  The key thing is to make the record as close in time to the action as possible.  For example, you feel like your pull requests aren't as good as other people's. Don't wait until the end of the week and then reflect on the quality of your work. Instead, every time your make a pull request, write down an accurate, objective assessment of the quality.\nPeople who suffer from imposter syndrome tend to forget their wins and remember their losses again and again (there's that rumination!). By having an accurate record that you made yourself you can cut through this and show to yourself your true performance.",

Their benefits were great, they were super inclusive, and management really focused on taking care of people.\nI left the bank for a small company that also claimed to be a best place to work. I didnt like the project I was on and they were quick to fire people to keep metrics like this up.\nI currently work for a small company that does not advertise about this and just might be the best employer I have ever had.

I used to get surveys these yearly at a past job from the Boston Globe / Best Places to Work and it was basically a third-party email to all employees with a survey you'd fill out.\nThe most anyone could realistically ask you to do was please fill out the survey positively to try and support the company if you believe it's a best place to work and remind more people to complete the surveys. I don't think companies are really out here trying to game the more reputable surveys, and it would be pretty easily for single employees to defect/report if they were. They also required some level of basic written comments from employees.\nProbably a mild green flag for quality of life / general happiness from current employees for the past year.",

I didn’t realize this until transferring to an office that had very few IT workers. Everyone in IT seemed miserable, while everyone outside of IT seemed extremely happy. I once made a rather sarcastic and cynical joke in the elevator to someone in a customer support role and it went over like a led ballon… but that was the language of everyone I worked with in IT. It was wild to me how two departments sitting 50 feet from each other could have such drastically different cultures. On town halls, everyone in the chat is brimming with company pride, meanwhile the side chats from people in the IT org are full of cynicism and sarcasm, with everyone trying to understand if these people are real or just bots… but I think they’re real.",

      "post_text": "I have been dealing with a Reddit Ads account issue over the last week, and it has quickly escalated into a severe privacy and security red flag. It appears their customer support tools (or the agents themselves) are actively bleeding PII and crossing user sessions entirely.<p>Over the last week, I have experienced three separate incidents in their live chat:<p>Incident 1: Account Cross-Contamination (Feb 14)\nWhile chatting with an agent (Sonam B), they managed to associate my personal email to a completely unrelated, bizarrely named ad account (&quot;No Panties Games Ad Account&quot;). When I pointed out they were pasting data related to someone else&#x27;s account alongside my email, they tried to brush it off as an &quot;error&quot; and told me to &quot;kindly ignore.&quot;<p>Incident 2: Direct PII Leak (Feb 20)\nToday, while following up on the issue with a different agent (Naheeda M), they inexplicably dropped the email address (info@<i>REDACTED</i>.com) and the full legal business entity name of an entirely different advertiser into our chat.<p>Incident 3: Total Session Confusion and Misattribution (Feb 20)\nJust minutes later in that same chat, things got much worse. While I was clearly logged into my own account, the agent told me: &quot;The ad account you&#x27;re currently signed into is u&#x2F;Teor<i>REDACTED</i>, and ads are getting published with this username. Is that correct?&quot;<p>This is no longer just a clipboard issue. This strongly suggests a severe backend mapping failure in their support dashboard (Zendesk&#x2F;Salesforce or an internal admin tool) that is completely misattributing active sessions, user accounts, and ad publishing data.<p>If their support agents are seeing me as logged into someone else&#x27;s account and claiming ads are publishing under that username, it raises massive questions:\n1. Are agents making changes to other people&#x27;s ad campaigns thinking it&#x27;s my account?\n2. Is ad spend being billed to the wrong accounts?\n3. Who is currently seeing my billing details, legal name, and campaigns?<p>Given how broken their Tier 1 tools appear to be right now, I wanted to raise the flag here immediately. Has anyone else running Reddit Ads noticed their support agents leaking data or confusing accounts recently?",

What do you know really well?  These are things that come from your personal experiences.  Note: this is generally not about software or coding skills--it's about everything else in the world.\n2. What are the problems or valuable opportunities in the areas you know well?  Where there are serious problems, there are opportunities for valuable solutions.\n3. Timing.  What's happening in the world and how do the changes open doors for new solutions?\n4. Market and Value.  How many people suffer with the problems you are trying to solve?  How well do you understand them?  How much money will they spend for a solution?  How many of these people have you spoken with: 25, 50, 100?\n5. Who is competing in your market?  What can you learn from them?  How does your solution compare?\nIt's best to consider several problems and conceptual solutions before settling on one.  Talk with people, build small prototypes, figure out if you truly understand the requirements.\nIf you do all of these things, you will have a much better shot at bringing forward a viable product and business idea.\nThere are some really good books out there on this whole process.

However, the drop is pretty massive. It is also a steady down trend, where it doesn't look like a change in how data is reported.\nThat said, they are still the #3 most visited site, and I'm having trouble adding anything to that chart that doesn't just look like a flat line in comparison to Facebook's peak. Looking at just the last 5 years lets us better see ChatGPT overtaking it and YouTube sitting on top of it.\nhttps://trends.google.com/explore?q=facebook%2C%2Fg%2F11khcf...\nI do hear of a lot of people using Facebook Marketplace, though I've never used it myself.

The main agent usually sees the 'Plugin' as a single tool (a 'super-tool') and delegates the specific MCP calls to a sub-agent or a controller within that plugin.\nIf you expose every underlying MCP tool individually to the main agent, you run into 'Context Window Bloat' where the agent gets confused by too many options.
