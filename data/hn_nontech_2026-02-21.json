      "post_text": "13 years ago, we launched Watsi.org with a Show HN [1].<p>For nearly a year, this community drove so much traffic that we couldn’t list patients fast enough. Then pg saw us on HN, wrote us our first big check, and accepted us as the first YC nonprofit (W13). The next few years were a whirlwind.<p>I was a young, naive founder with just enough experience to know I wanted Watsi to be more efficient, transparent, and innovative than most nonprofits. We spent 24&#x2F;7 talking to users and coding. We did things that don’t scale. We tried our best to be walking, talking pg essays.<p>Over the years we learned that product&#x2F;market fit is different for nonprofits. Not many people wake up and think, &quot;I&#x27;d love to donate to a nonprofit today&quot; with the same oomph that they think, &quot;I&#x27;d love a coffee&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;d like to make more money.&quot;<p>No matter how much effort we put into fundraising, donations grew linearly, while requests for care grew exponentially. I felt caught in the middle. After investing everything I had, I eventually burned out and transitioned to the board.<p>I made a classic founder mistake and intertwined my self-worth with Watsi&#x27;s success. I believed that if I could somehow help every patient, I was a good person, but if I let down some patients, which became inevitable, I was a bad person.<p>This was exacerbated by seeing our for-profit YC batch mates raise massive rounds. I felt like a failure for not scaling Watsi faster, but eventually we accepted reality and set Watsi on more of a slow, steady, and sustainable trajectory.<p>Now that I have perspective, I&#x27;m incredibly proud of what the org has accomplished and grateful to everyone who has done a tour of duty to support us. Watsi donors have donated over $20M to fund 33,241 surgeries, and we have a good shot of helping patients for a long time to come.<p>In a world of fast growth and fast crashes, here&#x27;s a huge thank you to the HN users who have stuck by Watsi, or any other important cause, even when it&#x27;s not on the front page. I believe it embodies the best of humanity. Thanks HN!<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4424081\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4424081</a>",

If your origin doesn't have IPv4, it wont route IPv4 to an IPv6 origin. Something Cloudflare could do. Still a shame its not a high priority.\nFor Domains, I am still on porkbun, but i have like 20 domains, and moving them to EU registrars would be pricey. I will do it, just not looking forward to it. Also there are few registrars tht handle all the TLDs i have, nothing like Porkbun. I use dot.bs to optimize my registrars and keep track of them.\nI self-host a lot, but I haven't done github. I have a Forgejo instance with working CI/CD, but there are some painpoints mirroring 100s of repos and updating PATs. Also I minimize how much critical infra I host. I do it as my day job. Don't want to do it so much at home, and I still do some between NAS and self-hosted services I do run.\nI do plan to try out Hanko and Nebius, those sound good. and Hit up scaleway to see if there is stuff I want to use there.

However, I've realized you can stay sovereign and independent in any jurisdiction (not just Europe) just by simplifying your stack and running a few baremetal servers in-house.\nJust buy a few Mac Studios and run them in-house with power supply backup and networking redundancy and you're good to go to serve more than 10k - 100k requests/second which is good enough to serve a million customers. You don't need VMs: a single Mac Studio gets you 2–4x the power of m7i.2xlarge on AWS, and pays for itself within a few months of AWS bills. You can do local AI inference and get Claude Opus-level performance (Kimi K2.5) over a cluster of Mac Studios with Exo.Labs (an unofficial Apple partner). You get free S3-compatible object storage with zero ongoing storage costs with MinIO (yes it's redundant even if you lose a server, and your hosting provider can't hold your data hostage by charging for egress). Postgres runs like a beast and is incredibly easy to setup - you get zero latency DB because it runs on the same machine, has access to lots of RAM and you're not paying per-GB or per-core. Managed databases are a scam. You don't need an Auth provider, just do passkeys yourself. And the great thing about Apple Silicon hardware is that it is amazingly quiet, reliable, and efficient - you can do thing like run headless browsers 3x faster and cheaper than on standard server hardware because of the unified memory and GPU acceleration, so you're not paying for CI/CD compute by-the-minute or headless browsers either.\nThis entire stack could give you computing power equivalent to a 25k euro/month AWS bill for the cost of electricity (same electricity cost as running a few fridges 24/7) plus about 50k euros one-time to set it up (about 4 Mac Studios). And yes, it's redundant, scalable, and even faster (in terms of per-request latency) than standard AWS/GCP cloud bloat. Not only is it cheaper and you own everything, but your app will work faster because all services are local (DB, Redis cache, SSD, etc.) without any VM overhead, shared cores, or noisy neighbours.",

A single RAID drive failed. Then, during the rebuild, a second drive failed. Then the RAID controller \nitself\n failed catastrophically, losing all the RAID volume metadata. When we restored from backup, we discovered that the sysadmin who had just quit a few weeks before had lied to us about the backup system, and we had no backups.\nThis is the sort of black swan event that happens every 5-10 years. It's an unusually bad event, even by black swan standards, but stuff like this happens.\nThe fundamental problem of self-hosted databases is that you test the happy path every day, but you only test true disaster recovery every 5-10 years. And in practice, this means that disaster recovery will usually fail.\nWith a managed database service, most of what you're paying goes to making sure that disaster recovery works. And in my experience, it does. I've seen RDS database servers fail catastrophically, and completely rebuild in under 15 minutes with virtually no data loss, with almost no human intervention at all.\nIf you care about your customers' data, I think that a reputable managed database is the right move until roughly the point that you can pay for a full time database administrator. At that point, sure, roll your own. But do regular disaster recovery tests, lest you discover that a recently departed DBA has been lying to you.",

I built a native macOS desktop client for Hacker News and I&#x27;m open-sourcing it under the MIT license.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IronsideXXVI&#x2F;Hacker-News\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IronsideXXVI&#x2F;Hacker-News</a><p>Download (signed &amp; notarized DMG, macOS 14.0+): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IronsideXXVI&#x2F;Hacker-News&#x2F;releases\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IronsideXXVI&#x2F;Hacker-News&#x2F;releases</a><p>Screenshots: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IronsideXXVI&#x2F;Hacker-News#screenshots\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IronsideXXVI&#x2F;Hacker-News#screenshots</a><p>I spend a lot of time reading HN — I wanted something that felt like a proper Mac app: a sidebar for browsing stories, an integrated reader for articles, and comment threading — all in one window. Essentially, I wanted HN to feel like a first-class citizen on macOS, not a website I visit.<p>What it does:<p>- Split-view layout — stories in a sidebar on the left, articles and comments on the right, using the standard macOS NavigationSplitView pattern.<p>- Built-in ad blocking — a precompiled WKContentRuleList blocks 14 major ad networks (DoubleClick, Google Syndication, Criteo, Taboola, Outbrain, Amazon ads, etc.) right in the WebKit layer. No extensions needed. Toggleable in settings.<p>- Pop-up blocking — kills window.open() calls. Also toggleable.<p>- HN account login — full authentication flow (login, account creation, password reset). Session is stored in the macOS Keychain, and cookies are injected into the WebView so you can upvote, comment, and submit stories while staying logged in.<p>- Bookmarks — save stories locally for offline access. Persisted with Codable serialization, searchable and filterable independently.<p>- Search and filtering — powered by the Algolia HN API. Filter by content type (All, Ask, Show, Jobs, Comments), date range (Today, Past Week, Past Month, All Time), and sort by hot or recent.<p>- Scroll progress indicator — a small orange bar at the top tracks your reading progress via JavaScript-to-native messaging.<p>- Auto-updates via Sparkle with EdDSA-signed updates served from GitHub Pages.<p>- Dark mode — respects system appearance with CSS and meta tag injection.<p>Tech details for the curious:<p>The whole app is ~2,050 lines of Swift across 16 files. It uses the modern @Observable macro (not the old ObservableObject&#x2F;Published pattern), structured concurrency with async&#x2F;await and withThrowingTaskGroup for concurrent batch fetching, and SwiftUI throughout — no UIKit&#x2F;AppKit bridges except for the WKWebView wrapper via NSViewRepresentable.<p>Two APIs power the data: the official HN Firebase API for individual item&#x2F;user fetches, and the Algolia Search API for feeds, filtering, and search. The Algolia API is surprisingly powerful for this — it lets you do date-range filtering, pagination, and full-text search that the Firebase API doesn&#x27;t support.<p>CI&#x2F;CD:<p>The release pipeline is a single GitHub Actions workflow (467 lines) that handles the full macOS distribution story: build and archive, code sign with Developer ID, notarize with Apple (with a 5-retry staple loop for ticket propagation delays), create a custom DMG with AppleScript-driven icon positioning, sign and notarize the DMG, generate an EdDSA Sparkle signature, create a GitHub Release, and deploy an updated appcast.xml to GitHub Pages.<p>Getting macOS code signing and notarization working in CI was honestly the hardest part of this project. If anyone is distributing a macOS app outside the App Store via GitHub Actions, I&#x27;m happy to answer questions — the workflow is fully open source.<p>The entire project is MIT licensed. PRs and issues welcome: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IronsideXXVI&#x2F;Hacker-News\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IronsideXXVI&#x2F;Hacker-News</a><p>I&#x27;d love feedback — especially on features you&#x27;d want to see. Some ideas I&#x27;m considering: keyboard-driven navigation (j&#x2F;k to move between stories), a reader mode that strips articles down to text, and notification support for replies to your comments.",

For the most part, I haven't been too discouraged by this as I prefer older MacOS designs over the newer ones.\nHowever, this is the second time in 2 days I've actually hit a wall in the Apple eco-system due to an older OS.\nLast night I tried to build Ghostty to hack on a feature... it needs Xcode SDK 26 which isn't supported on Xcode 14 (latest version I'm able to install).\nNow today, attempting to try this app out, I can't launch it due to being on too old of an OS.\nIt's really a shame because this iMac from 2017 is quite the capable machine.

And for a while, that's what it was. The disillusionment isn't really about AI or crypto or whatever the current hype cycle is. It's that the job has slowly drifted from \"engineer solving problems\" to \"employee managing process.\" You spend your morning in standups, your afternoon fighting with CI pipelines someone else configured, and your evening wondering what you actually built.\nThe people in this thread who say \"just get perspective, you could be loading trucks\" aren't wrong exactly, but they're answering a different question. Nobody here is saying the pay is bad or the chairs are uncomfortable. They're saying the work feels hollow. Those are different problems, and \"be grateful\" has never been a lasting fix for the second one.\nWhat I've noticed — both in myself and in people around me — is that the ones who stay engaged tend to have found a way to shrink their world back down.

      "post_text": "I have been dealing with a Reddit Ads account issue over the last week, and it has quickly escalated into a severe privacy and security red flag. It appears their customer support tools (or the agents themselves) are actively bleeding PII and crossing user sessions entirely.<p>Over the last week, I have experienced three separate incidents in their live chat:<p>Incident 1: Account Cross-Contamination (Feb 14)\nWhile chatting with an agent (Sonam B), they managed to associate my personal email to a completely unrelated, bizarrely named ad account (&quot;No Panties Games Ad Account&quot;). When I pointed out they were pasting data related to someone else&#x27;s account alongside my email, they tried to brush it off as an &quot;error&quot; and told me to &quot;kindly ignore.&quot;<p>Incident 2: Direct PII Leak (Feb 20)\nToday, while following up on the issue with a different agent (Naheeda M), they inexplicably dropped the email address (info@<i>REDACTED</i>.com) and the full legal business entity name of an entirely different advertiser into our chat.<p>Incident 3: Total Session Confusion and Misattribution (Feb 20)\nJust minutes later in that same chat, things got much worse. While I was clearly logged into my own account, the agent told me: &quot;The ad account you&#x27;re currently signed into is u&#x2F;Teor<i>REDACTED</i>, and ads are getting published with this username. Is that correct?&quot;<p>This is no longer just a clipboard issue. This strongly suggests a severe backend mapping failure in their support dashboard (Zendesk&#x2F;Salesforce or an internal admin tool) that is completely misattributing active sessions, user accounts, and ad publishing data.<p>If their support agents are seeing me as logged into someone else&#x27;s account and claiming ads are publishing under that username, it raises massive questions:\n1. Are agents making changes to other people&#x27;s ad campaigns thinking it&#x27;s my account?\n2. Is ad spend being billed to the wrong accounts?\n3. Who is currently seeing my billing details, legal name, and campaigns?<p>Given how broken their Tier 1 tools appear to be right now, I wanted to raise the flag here immediately. Has anyone else running Reddit Ads noticed their support agents leaking data or confusing accounts recently?",

          "top": "Imposter syndrome is a thinking trap.  A couple of things you can do to help:\nTry to separate out 'ruminating' from 'thinking'.  What's the difference? For our purposes 'thinking' has a fixed outcome and an end point.  Trying to solve a coding problem. Working out how to make dinner. Calculating your taxes. When you reach your goal, you're done and you stop.  'Ruminating' has no end point. There is not end or action associated with it.  The tricky part is that it often masquerades as thinking, so you feel like you're solving a problem.\nFor example, you do a job interview and you go over and over what happened in your mind. \"Maybe I should have answered this differently\". \"Maybe I should've prepared some more of these questions\".  Of course, you can't change what happened in the past. You're just rolling the ideas around in your head and probably making yourself feel worse and worse.  Rumination can be focused on the past, the future or even some hypothetical, imaginary situation (\"What if I lost my job\", \"What if my house burnt down\"). Again, actual preparation (Saving an emergency fund. Getting insurance) has an action associated, but rumination never ends, it just keeps going around in your head.\nThe other thing is to keep an accurate record of your performance. This will be different for everyone, and varies a lot depending on the job.  The key thing is to make the record as close in time to the action as possible.  For example, you feel like your pull requests aren't as good as other people's. Don't wait until the end of the week and then reflect on the quality of your work. Instead, every time your make a pull request, write down an accurate, objective assessment of the quality.\nPeople who suffer from imposter syndrome tend to forget their wins and remember their losses again and again (there's that rumination!). By having an accurate record that you made yourself you can cut through this and show to yourself your true performance.",

This is basically your AWS.

              "text": "I feel like there's no market for this. Or at the very least, it's an incredibly niche market. Hear me out :)\nFirstly, this is a pretty expensive approach to cooking, so you're already in a narrow space (people with money). There are a lot of products in this space already, from restaurants to (high quality) frozen meals etc.\n(Aside - meals for 4 implies kids, and people with kids tend to have financial boundaries.)\nSecond you want health food. So again, more niche inside your niche. My instinct (since I've done no actual market research) is that people who are into health food aren't great candidates for subscriptions. They're into provenance, minimizing waste, and so on.\nThirdly, you're asking people to cook the meal. (Which I applaud, cooking meals is a good thing.) But cooking is easy. Once you've learned 10 dishes it's easy to learn another one. And you tweak to suit your taste. At which point your \"service\" is little more than grocery delivery.\nPrepping food actually takes minimal time (in the real world). To a novice getting an onion peeled or chopped might be a time saver, but in reality it takes seconds to do it manually. Honestly the time spent ordering etc would dwarf savings here.\nLastly, there's little incentive for people to remain on this service long-term. Maybe it's useful in the learning phase. But it's a quick cut as skills develop. So short term, high turnover customer base.\nObviously it could be done. In a rich neighborhood you might even get enough customers to keep a delivery guy busy. But outside of SF I don't see it catching on.\nBut don't worry about what I think, I've been wrong many times. All I suggest is lots of market research first (perhaps outside California. )",

It won't work in expensive places like SF or NYC, because the people who move there are happy to pat paprika on a chicken and toss them into an air fryer. Or live on rice and beans.\nHere there's some cultural pressure on people to cook for their families. Especially Asian moms. Someone feeding their kids McDonald's and frozen meals is going to be judged, but what's a parent who works 996 supposed to do? Though back when I was in uni, we'd take turns preparing dinner; I can see it working for students as well.\nCooking is also always cheaper than buying it off the shelf. We buy the frozen spinach despite it being 3x the cost of fresh spinach because we don't want to wash the sand out of spinach and then wash the sand out of the sink.\nMy problem is we have a bunch of stuff in the fridge. Prep is less about time, more about energy. I'm hungry, I don't want to peel carrots. We buy large batches of fish over the weekend and clean them up and prepare them, but they're in the sink 4 days a week and 2 of those days we just end up eating outside.\nI think everyone wants healthy food as a core meal. We're talking something other than pasta with butter - the health ministry suggests dishes of 1/4 carbs, 1/4 protein and 1/2 veggies. But what choices do you have here? Nobody wants to retrofit their usual dishes to have less carbs and more veggies, lol. Cutting down on protein also cuts cost. Tim Ferris says eat the same thing every other day but most people don't do this, especially not kids. There are plenty of healthy options. Grilled veggies do taste great and so are things like minestrone. Burgers can pass the health food bar too.",

What do you know really well?  These are things that come from your personal experiences.  Note: this is generally not about software or coding skills--it's about everything else in the world.\n2. What are the problems or valuable opportunities in the areas you know well?  Where there are serious problems, there are opportunities for valuable solutions.\n3. Timing.  What's happening in the world and how do the changes open doors for new solutions?\n4. Market and Value.  How many people suffer with the problems you are trying to solve?  How well do you understand them?  How much money will they spend for a solution?  How many of these people have you spoken with: 25, 50, 100?\n5. Who is competing in your market?  What can you learn from them?  How does your solution compare?\nIt's best to consider several problems and conceptual solutions before settling on one.  Talk with people, build small prototypes, figure out if you truly understand the requirements.\nIf you do all of these things, you will have a much better shot at bringing forward a viable product and business idea.\nThere are some really good books out there on this whole process.

What they mean by personality is among these:\n* excellent soft skills - can listen and emotionally bond with others\n* excellent written communication - the ability to put into writing high precision content with minimal revision that is well structured.  It should not take advanced effort to turn meeting notes into a formal written recommendation.\n* discipline / conscientiousness - this is awareness of the space outside yourself.  It is the ability to balance 6 things at once with endurance throughout the day.\nYes, technical skills can be taught.  Hiring managers really prefer to retain their people and not have to rehire, so teaching people is a long game of minimal continuous effort from the leader via proper assignments and continuous practice on the part of the individual contributor.  If the individual contributor also does this work as a hobby outside the office that is even better, but it would be a massive ethical violation to impose this or it intermingle it with assigned tasks.\nI am a hiring manager, by the way.\nFrom a tooling perspective I am not sure.  My organization uses a tool called GreenHouse.  It contains a candidate's resume and credentials and allows HR to build out forms for interview feedback.  The insight part is always a challenge.  I am fully remote so I am actively watching everything a candidate does with their eyeballs as much or more than listen to the content of their answers, because I want to know what they are thinking and what they are looking at since AI prompts during interviews is now a thing.\nWhen I do look at a resume what I am only looking at:\n* Years of total experience\n* Job hopping versus loyalty/duration\n* Credentials like education attainment, certifications, and so forth",

We need a trusted third-party as a validator so everyone is happy. Otherwise, we bring bias and corruption into this.\nThe problem is currently solved by professional certification — yes it could be gamed but it provides an official confirmation from a reputable source rather than someone’s word that you’re good.\nPlease keep iterating! We need better tools!",

The idea is to avoid the corruption and bias by hand picking a starter deck of super trusted few professionals who would be able to verify others.\nFor example to prove someone is an senior engineer from google I can ask for a pay slip and references and yes certifications, so we would become that rusted partner. Still working on the proposal and iterations, I wanna talk to much engineers, hiring manages as possible since this is going to be for everyone, to navigate this wild job market.\nWe definitely need better tools, at the moment it is wild that it takes 1000 of applications to just get an answer from any company, this not right at all",

A few points:\n- You say \"engineering\" verification, I checked and it's all computer science, monkey coding, full stack whatever,  not only is that NOT engineering, it wasn't before generative AI, and it's definitely not now. This is programming. Programming is writing, and with AI it's more of storytelling rather than engineering.\n- How would this platform measure real engineering skills? Critical thinking, problem solving, etc.? What about Electrical Engineering? Civil Engineering? Robotics design? Etc.\n- I didn't open an account, but on the first page it asks for LinkedIn.. really? I don't trust most of what I read there. GitHub? Not only does it bring us back to software-related topics, but what if I don't use GitHub?\nI think the best way to verify someone's skills in the engineering world is a portfolio that shows their projects and what was accomplished during them. A resume will never be enough, and interviews should be limited to personal interactions and assessing how the potential candidate communicates. Where needed, maybe an assignment to complete and return after a few days -one that mimics the potential project or role they will be working on- because asking questions during an interview is not enough to measure their skills at all.",

It is meant to be all kinds of engineering, the vision is to have all type of engineers from software engineers(which you are correct it is focused full on that).\n> How would this platform measure real engineering skills? Critical thinking, problem solving, etc.? What about Electrical Engineering? Civil Engineering? Robotics design? Etc\n- This will be all up to the hand picked person to measure your skills, for example the verifier will be assessing everything required to determine if someone is really good or not, that includes critical thinking, problem solving so on. Let's say this verifier they work/ed for Google, they will bring Google's interview framework to this candidate software engineer in our case to asses their skills, the expected result would be \"I passed the assessment, I could be good as an engineer at Google\" which helps with credibility. \nThe platform itself will store the final decision on your profile (you can hide or show anything up to the user).\n> I didn't open an account, but on the first page it asks for LinkedIn.. really? I don't trust most of what I read there. GitHub? Not only does it bring us back to software-related topics, but what if I don't use GitHub?\n- Linkedin, github or gitlab are all optional fields, I have pushed a fix on that to communicate it better, thank you. I am thinking of making it a free link field to be portfolio rather than profile from github, gitlab or whatever else. Personally I understand this, not a fan of github at all, I just put it there since it is the most used.\nThis is how I imagine it and actually tested this concept and it worked and you are 100% right it brings a lot of results. What I did was fist meet and greet talk, then assign take at home project, after the project was done, then we discussed the decisions made and approaches and how the problem was solved, and talked about past projects from the portfolio. This reduced the chance significantly of a bad hire, and the candidates liked the concept a lot.\nWhat don't you like the most from the current hiring processes? For example in software engineering for me is solving meaningless problems during interviews like reverse a binary tree that have nothing to do with the actual role.",

The main agent usually sees the 'Plugin' as a single tool (a 'super-tool') and delegates the specific MCP calls to a sub-agent or a controller within that plugin.\nIf you expose every underlying MCP tool individually to the main agent, you run into 'Context Window Bloat' where the agent gets confused by too many options. Keeping them 'hidden' behind the plugin interface is actually better for agentic stability in a production environment.",
