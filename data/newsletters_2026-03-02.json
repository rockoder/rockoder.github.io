While we dove a bit into the incentives and institutional pressures that cause those companies to make such wildly irresponsible decisions, what we haven’t yet reckoned with is how we hold these companies accountable. Often, people tell me they feel overwhelmed at the idea of trying to engage with getting laws passed, or fighting a big politi",

As has become clear this week, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has declined to do so. The administration couches the request as an attempt to use the technology for “lawful purposes”, but given that they’ve also described their recent crimes as legal, t",

Code has always been expensive. Producing a few hundred lines of clean, tested code takes most software developers a full day or more. Many of our engineering habits, at both the macro and micro level, are built around this core constraint. At the macro level we spend a great deal of time designing, estimating a",

For a lot of things this doesn't matter: if the code fetches some data from a database and outputs it as JSON the implementation details are likely simple enough that we don't need to care. We can try out the new feature and make a very solid guess at how it works, then glance over the code to be sure. Often though the details really do matter. If the core of our application be",
