      "post_text": "13 years ago, we launched Watsi.org with a Show HN [1].<p>For nearly a year, this community drove so much traffic that we couldn’t list patients fast enough. Then pg saw us on HN, wrote us our first big check, and accepted us as the first YC nonprofit (W13). The next few years were a whirlwind.<p>I was a young, naive founder with just enough experience to know I wanted Watsi to be more efficient, transparent, and innovative than most nonprofits. We spent 24&#x2F;7 talking to users and coding. We did things that don’t scale. We tried our best to be walking, talking pg essays.<p>Over the years we learned that product&#x2F;market fit is different for nonprofits. Not many people wake up and think, &quot;I&#x27;d love to donate to a nonprofit today&quot; with the same oomph that they think, &quot;I&#x27;d love a coffee&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;d like to make more money.&quot;<p>No matter how much effort we put into fundraising, donations grew linearly, while requests for care grew exponentially. I felt caught in the middle. After investing everything I had, I eventually burned out and transitioned to the board.<p>I made a classic founder mistake and intertwined my self-worth with Watsi&#x27;s success. I believed that if I could somehow help every patient, I was a good person, but if I let down some patients, which became inevitable, I was a bad person.<p>This was exacerbated by seeing our for-profit YC batch mates raise massive rounds. I felt like a failure for not scaling Watsi faster, but eventually we accepted reality and set Watsi on more of a slow, steady, and sustainable trajectory.<p>Now that I have perspective, I&#x27;m incredibly proud of what the org has accomplished and grateful to everyone who has done a tour of duty to support us. Watsi donors have donated over $20M to fund 33,241 surgeries, and we have a good shot of helping patients for a long time to come.<p>In a world of fast growth and fast crashes, here&#x27;s a huge thank you to the HN users who have stuck by Watsi, or any other important cause, even when it&#x27;s not on the front page. I believe it embodies the best of humanity. Thanks HN!<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4424081\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4424081</a>",

I visit it more often than I'd like to admit.\nI have been building a startup since the last couple of years and as we all know it is relentless. There are weeks where nothing seems to work, where you question every decision. In those moments, pulling up that page and seeing real people whose lives changed because of a few dollars a month — it resets something. It reminds me why building things that matter is worth the grind.\nThank you to everyone at Watsi for creating something that gives back to donors just as much as it gives to patients.",

The situation has only gotten worse with Jassy's reckless directive for the entire organization to push into Generative AI (\nhttps://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-and...\n). So much basic stuff is just breaking down, and seller support is overwhelmed or unable to intervene to fix the mess.\nYou can see a small sample here involving problems with product attributes (\nhttps://sellercentral.amazon.com/seller-forums/discussions?s...\n). Google \"Amazon AWD delays\" or \"Amazon CSBA problems\" or \"Amazon remote fulfillment problems\" to see examples of programs that are unable to provide even basic levels of the services promised to sellers.\nMeanwhile, Amazon has been so greedy with fees since Jassy took over that sellers of all sizes and many small to midsized brands are being squeezed out of existence or driven off Amazon. Its PPC ad platform is completely predatory, loaded with dark patterns and hidden defaults that add billions to top-line revenue while strip-mining the accounts of sellers who often have no choice but to participate in the auctions.\nIt's clear that Amazon is running scared when it comes to dealing with new competition, including the Chinese shopping sites and the looming prospect of agentic AI and other new AI-powered shopping tools eating its lunch. For the first time ever last month, I saw an Amazon search results (via Rufus) that actually directed shoppers to third-party brand sites. This would have been heresy 5 years ago.",

I won the first round, but Amazon refuses to participate in second-round disputes - so despite overwhelming evidence of five separate fraud attempts, they sent a generic email and docked $5k from my seller account.\n- Amazon then refused to answer any further communications, including basic disclosure of which card issuer was involved or what evidence was submitted - making any independent appeal impossible.\n- Every dispute stage (A-Z, returns, chargebacks) required rebuilding the fraud case from scratch.

Instead of a standard chat conversation, the LLM returns question forms the user can directly interact with (and use to continue the conversation with the LLM).<p>2. Because I thought it would be cool to have a site dedicated to interactive educational content instead of purely consuming content (which I do too much).<p>An example of a (useful-for-me) interactive conversation is: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rebrain.gg&#x2F;conversations&#x2F;6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rebrain.gg&#x2F;conversations&#x2F;6</a>.

I did see one bug early in the conversation: \"The submission shows an escaped/unfinished string: find . -name \\.\" which looks like an error converting what the user chose back to an escaped string for the AI.\nFor feedback:\n* Please change the colours. I can't read white text on light purple. By all means keep purple, just increase the contrast.\n* Maybe keep it in a narrower column, again for readability especially since we're constantly switching sides left to right as we read the AI text and the 'You submitted' text. I also feel it's quite duplicated, I can visually see which option was chosen yet it's restated in 'You submitted'. Only show what's necessary.\n* In the replay you shared I can still change active radio buttons. Make it static.\nTo more focused feedback:\n* I really like the idea. Instead of an AI telling you the answer, you learn -- this is fantastic.\n* Multiple choice questions are great, but eventually please move to freeform. An AI can evaluate that. (For example, after learning a bit via examples, it might prompt, 'How do you find all PDFs in your home folder?' and give a text entry field. In the past, you'd have to type exactly the string the app expected; with an AI, it can evaluate flexibly. So take advantage of this. It's an immense opportunity vs earlier learning platforms.) Also, people learn better at some point when you're not given answers (aka multiple choice) but need to write.\nI think you're on to something. AI as thinking replacement is a worry. AI as a guided teacher is great. I look forward to what you do with it.",

I'm also going to see if I can come up with some different question formats beyond multiple choice, free-form and multi select (which the llm doesn't use too much).",

In previous versions I would build something, then restart from scratch — but always reusing pieces and, more importantly, the learning from the prior attempts. The big leap happened in the last few months, mainly due to an architectural decision (moving to a plugin-based core) and the noticeable improvement in LLM precision, which made iteration much more reliable.\nFor me this is a side project, so I only dedicate a few hours per day. I started the first iteration less than a year ago, and the current iteration began about four months ago.\nI completely understand the anxiety around what LLMs can now produce — but I also think building something robust and production-ready still requires a lot of architectural thinking and long-term iteration.",

I had to revise 10 drafts before I had the final version. When I stopped using AI for my texts, my productivity increased, and I can now complete an essay in 1-2 drafts, which is 5 times faster than when using AI.\nThis is strikingly different from development. In development, AI increases my productivity fivefold, but in texts, it slows me down.\nI thought, maybe the problem is simply that I don't know how to write texts, but I do know how to develop?\nBut the thing is, AI development uses standard code, with recognized patterns, techniques, and architecture. It does what (almost) the best programmer in their field would do. And its code can be checked with linters and tests.

I’m now at a company building a deeply distributed systems product, and I’m surrounded by incredibly talented engineers who seem exceptionally strong at what they do. They often have knowledge and intuition about things I barely understand.<p>Lately, I’ve been feeling inadequate — like I’m contributing more to the less exciting parts of the product rather than the “cool” or core engineering challenges.<p>On top of that, I’m an immigrant and my wife and I are expecting. Balancing that with a fully remote job has been difficult, and at times I feel like I’ve lost some of my competence or sharpness. I’m taking steps to address this — I’ll be speaking with a psychologist soon — but I genuinely wonder: how does someone overcome these feelings while working within a high-functioning engineering team?",

          "top": "Imposter syndrome is a thinking trap.  A couple of things you can do to help:\nTry to separate out 'ruminating' from 'thinking'.  What's the difference? For our purposes 'thinking' has a fixed outcome and an end point.  Trying to solve a coding problem. Working out how to make dinner. Calculating your taxes. When you reach your goal, you're done and you stop.  'Ruminating' has no end point. There is not end or action associated with it.  The tricky part is that it often masquerades as thinking, so you feel like you're solving a problem.\nFor example, you do a job interview and you go over and over what happened in your mind. \"Maybe I should have answered this differently\". \"Maybe I should've prepared some more of these questions\".  Of course, you can't change what happened in the past. You're just rolling the ideas around in your head and probably making yourself feel worse and worse.  Rumination can be focused on the past, the future or even some hypothetical, imaginary situation (\"What if I lost my job\", \"What if my house burnt down\"). Again, actual preparation (Saving an emergency fund. Getting insurance) has an action associated, but rumination never ends, it just keeps going around in your head.\nThe other thing is to keep an accurate record of your performance. This will be different for everyone, and varies a lot depending on the job.  The key thing is to make the record as close in time to the action as possible.  For example, you feel like your pull requests aren't as good as other people's. Don't wait until the end of the week and then reflect on the quality of your work. Instead, every time your make a pull request, write down an accurate, objective assessment of the quality.\nPeople who suffer from imposter syndrome tend to forget their wins and remember their losses again and again (there's that rumination!). By having an accurate record that you made yourself you can cut through this and show to yourself your true performance.",

Many of the tricks they use become first class objects of frontier models/tooling or are unnecessary 2 model versions later.\nWhat you can do is empower your agent to solve more complex problems fully on its own. See if you can write a plan (claude is great at writing plans) that encapsulates all the work needed for a feature. Go back and forth with the AI on the plan. Spend some time thinking about it. Including tests, how the AI can automatically validate that things work, etc. Put it on auto-accept and tab away. Once it finishes, review the code, do your normal QA, follow ups, etc\nWhile it's working, go work on another feature in the same vein. Git worktrees  are a simple way to work on the same codebase in parallel (though you likely work on an app that isn't set up for multiple instances of it running in parallel, have fun with that). Containers are another way to run these in parallel. Vibe code yourself a local tool to manage these. This is somewhat built into the claude/codex desktop apps, but you likely need to customize it for your environment\nBasically you do the architecture, code review & QA and let the model do as much of the code as possible, and try to do it in parallel. I still do manual coding when I need to explore what a solution might look like, but AI is much faster at experimenting with larger solutions, and if you don't like what it did, it's a `git checkout .` away from a clean slate\nHow much time you spend on validating is a tradeoff of speed vs correctness needs for your business.",

Also startup CEOs will sit down with a hologram and tell it what they want to do, and why they think they are uniquely positioned to execute on their vision compared to other humans in their field. The robot/hologram may end up working with a few humans in the same area, creating competition between them, but will eventually aim to drive them all to the ground in the end, like HAL.\nBut companies should be much more careful about where they host their \"proprietary\" code.

Why not groups of developers?\nI shelved a music/entertainment/ticketing/touring startup from 15 years ago, built with Django that launched but never got any real users, as I put it on hold to focus on other things (crypto.)

If you notice the coding assistant referring to this you know they are aware, and they do sometimes refer to it. I also have a common list of principles but I think they are less useful because those are generic for software engineering.\n3) Occasionally, I will do the following prompt:\ni) Who am I?\nii) What is our design philosophy and tenets?\niii) Go through the repo and ensure the architecture and codebase adheres to our design philosophy and tenets.\nKind of works.",
