      "post_text": "13 years ago, we launched Watsi.org with a Show HN [1].<p>For nearly a year, this community drove so much traffic that we couldn’t list patients fast enough. Then pg saw us on HN, wrote us our first big check, and accepted us as the first YC nonprofit (W13). The next few years were a whirlwind.<p>I was a young, naive founder with just enough experience to know I wanted Watsi to be more efficient, transparent, and innovative than most nonprofits. We spent 24&#x2F;7 talking to users and coding. We did things that don’t scale. We tried our best to be walking, talking pg essays.<p>Over the years we learned that product&#x2F;market fit is different for nonprofits. Not many people wake up and think, &quot;I&#x27;d love to donate to a nonprofit today&quot; with the same oomph that they think, &quot;I&#x27;d love a coffee&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;d like to make more money.&quot;<p>No matter how much effort we put into fundraising, donations grew linearly, while requests for care grew exponentially. I felt caught in the middle. After investing everything I had, I eventually burned out and transitioned to the board.<p>I made a classic founder mistake and intertwined my self-worth with Watsi&#x27;s success. I believed that if I could somehow help every patient, I was a good person, but if I let down some patients, which became inevitable, I was a bad person.<p>This was exacerbated by seeing our for-profit YC batch mates raise massive rounds. I felt like a failure for not scaling Watsi faster, but eventually we accepted reality and set Watsi on more of a slow, steady, and sustainable trajectory.<p>Now that I have perspective, I&#x27;m incredibly proud of what the org has accomplished and grateful to everyone who has done a tour of duty to support us. Watsi donors have donated over $20M to fund 33,241 surgeries, and we have a good shot of helping patients for a long time to come.<p>In a world of fast growth and fast crashes, here&#x27;s a huge thank you to the HN users who have stuck by Watsi, or any other important cause, even when it&#x27;s not on the front page. I believe it embodies the best of humanity. Thanks HN!<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4424081\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4424081</a>",

I visit it more often than I'd like to admit.\nI have been building a startup since the last couple of years and as we all know it is relentless. There are weeks where nothing seems to work, where you question every decision. In those moments, pulling up that page and seeing real people whose lives changed because of a few dollars a month — it resets something. It reminds me why building things that matter is worth the grind.\nThank you to everyone at Watsi for creating something that gives back to donors just as much as it gives to patients.",

      "post_text": "Hi HN,\nAfter roughly 8 years of silently rolling 1.1 nightlies, we finally tagged a proper stable 2.0 release.\nWe built this because wrist-sized Linux is genuinely fun to hack on, and because a handful of us think it&#x27;s worth keeping capable hardware alive long after manufacturers move on. Smartwatches don&#x27;t really get old — the silicon is basically the same as it was a decade ago. We just keep making it useful for us.<p>No usage stats, no tracking, no illusions of mass adoption. The only real signal we get is the occasional person who appears in our Matrix chat going &quot;hey, it booted on my watch from 2014 and now it&#x27;s usable again&quot; — and that&#x27;s plenty.<p>Privacy is non-negotiable: zero telemetry, no cloud, full local control. Longevity is the other half: we refuse to let good hardware become e-waste just because support ended.\nOn the learning side, it&#x27;s been one of the best playgrounds: instant feedback on your wrist makes QML&#x2F;Qt, JavaScript watchfaces and embedded Linux feel tangible. The community is small and kind — perfect for people who want to learn open-source dev without gatekeeping.<p>Technically we&#x27;re still pragmatic: libhybris + older kernels on most devices since it just works, but we&#x27;ve already mainlined rinato (Samsung Gear 2) and sparrow (ASUS ZenWatch 2) — rinato even boots with a usable UI. That&#x27;s the direction we&#x27;re pushing toward.<p>Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AsteroidOS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AsteroidOS</a> \nInstall images &amp; docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asteroidos.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asteroidos.org</a> \n2.0 demo video : <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=U6FiQz0yACc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=U6FiQz0yACc</a> \nAnnouncement post: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asteroidos.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2-0-release&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asteroidos.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2-0-release&#x2F;</a><p>Questions, port requests, mentoring offers, criticism, weird ideas — all welcome.

But now seems like a good time to experiment with one of the watches you support.\nI also still dream of one day daily driving a Linux smartphone, but that feels a bit more unrealistic to me, as I have more expectations from a phone, like being able to use bank apps and having a good battery life. But for a smartwatch, which I only expect to show me some biometrics and pass notifications from my phone, this seems perfect.\nOn this note: aren't JavaScript and QML/Qt too heavy/bloated for a device so small? I expect them to constrain performance and battery life quite a bit, but I admit I don't have a clue and would love to be proven wrong...",

Pick a high number of course!\nIf you're in a position where you can't afford not to answer, you should pick a reasonable number, and take whatever they give you, because you completely lack agency. This is the case where you might screw yourself out of money, but if you need the job that badly, do you really care?\nA better way to frame this, and this is always what I do if I have the agency to not answer, is to give them the number I'd like or remain mum, but either way when they make the final offer just ask them a simple question: \"Is there any way you can come up a little bit from that?\". If they say no, you decide based on that first number. But they'll almost always say yes, and you'll get a small effortless raise.\nI've done this about 10 times across my career and about 70-80% of the time I've gotten a bump in the 5-10% range.

Importantly, I’m no public figure nor I’m 10x developer, I’m just a regular guy who chose Go very early in my career, just before it really took off.\nNow, imagine that I don’t ask for a number nor share my expectations. With 3-4 rounds of interviews, even if we assume 1/10 is in my range, I’d have to SUCCESSFULLY do maybe 30-40 interviews on average to find a job that matches my expectations.

          "top": "Hi, I'm Clint, one of the co-authors of this paper.\nI'd like to quickly summarize what is different about our approach and why it matters.\nOur work was inspired by brilliant research done at MIT CSAIL on \"Recursive Language Models\" (RLMs). One of the controversies has been whether these models are just a formalization of what agents like Claude Code already do vs. whether they bring new capabilities to the table.\nBy outperforming Claude on the major long-context benchmark, we provide a strong signal that something fundamentally new is happening. (In other words, it's not \"just Claude Code\" because it demonstrably outperforms Claude Code in the long-context regime.)\nWhere our contribution, LCM, differs from RLMs is how we handle recursion. RLMs use \"symbolic recursion\" -- i.e., they have an LLM write a script to recursively call itself in order to manipulate the context, which is stored in a REPL. This provides maximum flexibility... but it often goes wrong, since the LLM may write imperfect scripts.\nLCM attempts to decompose the recursion from RLMs into deterministic primitives so that the control flow can be managed by an engine rather than left to the whims of the LLM. In practice, this means we replace bespoke scripts with two mechanisms: \n(1) A DAG-based context management system that works like paged virtual memory, except for managing conversations and files;\nand \n(2) Operator-level recursion, like \"Map\" for LLMs, which lets one tool call process thousands of tasks.\nAn analogy we draw in the paper is the evolution from GO-TO statements (of Dijkstra's \"Considered Harmful\" fame) to structured programming. RLMs are maximally expressive, but all of that power comes with the risk of things going awry. We have built a more mechanistic system, which can provide stronger guarantees when deployed in production with today's models.\nHappy to answer any questions! Thanks for taking a look at the paper!",

              "text": "Hi NWU,\nWe don't have any other materials yet, but let's see if this lands for you. I can run you through a couple simpler versions of the system, why they don't work, and how that informs our ultimate design.\nThe most basic part of the system is \"two layers\". Layer 1 is the \"ground truth\" of the conversation - the whole text the user sees. Layer 2 is what the model sees, i.e., the active context window.\nIn a perfect world, those would be the same thing. But, as you know, context lengths aren't long enough for that, so we can't fit everything from Layer 1 into Layer 2.\nSo instead we keep a \"pointer\" to the appropriate part of Layer 1 in Layer 2. That pointer takes the form of a summary. But it's not a summary designed to contain all information. It's more like a \"label\" that makes sure the model knows where to look.\nThe naive version of the system would allow the main model to expand Layer 2 summaries by importing all of the underlying data from Layer 1. But this doesn't work well, because then you just end up re-filling the Layer 2 context window.\nSo instead you let the main model \nclone\n itself, the clone expands the summary in its context (and can do this for multiple summaries, transforming each into the original uncompressed text), and then the clone returns whatever information the main thread requires.\nWhere this system would not fully match the capabilities of RLMs is that, by writing a script that calls itself e.g. thousands of times, an RLM has the ability to make many more recursive tool calls than can fit in a context window.  So we fix that using operator-level recursion, i.e., we give the LLM a tool, map, that executes arbitrary recursion, without the LLM having to write a custom script to accomplish that.\nHope this helps!\n- Clint",

Restart and reframe the prompt and the problems at hand and try again.\nI'm not totally sure about the language you are using, but syntax errors typically happens if it \"forgets\" to update some of the code, and very seldom just in a single file or edit.\nI like to create a design.md and think a bit on my own, or maybe prompt to create it with a high level problem to get going, and make sure it's in the context (and mentioned in the prompts)",

I reviewed detailed plans for each phase before Claude started. I often asked Claude to update these detailed plans before starting.

I can test out new ideas much faster.\nFor example, \nhttps://github.com/Leftium/gg\n started out as 100% hand-crafted code. I wanted gg to be able to print out the expression in the code in addition to the value like python icecream. (It's more useful to get both the value and the variable name/expression.) I previously tried, and gave up. Claude helped me add this feature within a few hours.\nAnd now gg has its own virtual dev console optimized for interacting with coding agents. A very useful feature that I would probaly not have attempted without Claude. It's taken the \"open in editor\" feture to a completely new level.\nI have implemented other features that I would have never attempted or even thought about.

Use git in order to make rock solid steps that Claude will not touch when it works and you can revert changes or ask the ia to explore a branch, explaining how you did something and want something similar.\n7. Do not modify code that already works rock solid. Copy it into another step leaving the step as reference and modify it there.\n5.Use logs. Lots of logs.

So you have to focus a lot on what the source text is that’s going to be used to produce the completion. The better the source text, the better the completion. In other words, you need to make sure you progressively fill the context window with stuff that matters for the task that you’re doing.\nIn particular, first explore the problem space with the tool (iterate), then use the exploration results to plan what needs doing (iterate), when the plan looks good and makes sense, only then you ask to actually implement.\nClaude’s built in planning mode kind of does this, but in my opinion it sucks. It doesn’t make iterating on the exploration and the plan easy or natural.

There's other ways to tune RA rate by also adjusting when and where the vehicles operate, which comes down to standard taxi fleet management tools (e.g. price and availability).\nWaymo chooses a target that they're comfortable with and probably changes it every so often, but those numbers aren't the only possible targets and they're not necessarily well-correlated to the system's \"true\" capabilities (which are themselves difficult to understand).",

I know that's why some frown on this template-based auto-placeholders because they want the code to better resemble the queries as they run in Postgres.\n(Also yeah, it might be nice if Postgres also supported named placeholders like some of the other SQL databases do.)",

You could probably print a 177x177 grid on a regular Prusa MK4 and just have a color change layer. E.g. layer 1 white, and then layer 2 black. This would be 2,953 bytes.\nYou could even get a binder, and then print the QR codes sheets as 'pages'.  You could print these thin enough to do 1mm sheets. That means ~ 120 of these in a 5 inch binder. So, a 3 ring binder of 1mm sheets of 177x177 QR codes would hold about 346.2 KiB. You could store encryption keys in this way. You can probably push the density well past 177x177 even on a Mk4s pretty safely. I may try this later today.",

I had to revise 10 drafts before I had the final version. When I stopped using AI for my texts, my productivity increased, and I can now complete an essay in 1-2 drafts, which is 5 times faster than when using AI.\nThis is strikingly different from development. In development, AI increases my productivity fivefold, but in texts, it slows me down.\nI thought, maybe the problem is simply that I don't know how to write texts, but I do know how to develop?\nBut the thing is, AI development uses standard code, with recognized patterns, techniques, and architecture. It does what (almost) the best programmer in their field would do. And its code can be checked with linters and tests.
