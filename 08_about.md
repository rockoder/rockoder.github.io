My name is Ganesh Pagade.

I'm a Software Engineering Lead living in Berlin, Germany. I currently work at Zalando.  

I've studied at [ISSC](http://issc.unipune.ac.in/) (Computer Science Masters) and [Symbiosis](http://www.siu.edu.in/) (Executive MBA).  

I'm a freelance technical blog writer mainly covering advance topics in Java and Spring. Here's [my profile as an author at Baeldung](http://www.baeldung.com/author/ganesh-pagade/) which is a technical site focused on the Java ecosystem, with a reach of about 2.5M page views per month.  

I've taught graduate and post graduate computer science courses.  

I've worked as a freelance software developer.  

Besides [in respect and admiration, to the spirit that lives in the computer](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/Dedication.xhtml#Dedication), I enjoy reading about working of human brain.

**rockoder** - I did some online freelance coding while in college. This is the account name you come up with when listening too much music and writing too much code. Pronounced as rock-coder.
