About Genode
The Genode OS Framework is a tool kit for building highly secure special-purpose operating systems. It scales from embedded systems with as little as 4 MB of memory to highly dynamic general-purpose workloads.
Genode is based on a recursive system structure. Each program runs in a dedicated sandbox and gets granted only those access rights and resources that are needed for its specific purpose. Programs can create and manage sub-sandboxes out of their own resources, thereby forming hierarchies where policies can be applied at each level. The framework provides mechanisms to let programs communicate with each other and trade their resources, but only in strictly-defined manners. Thanks to this rigid regime, the attack surface of security-critical functions can be reduced by orders of magnitude compared to contemporary operating systems.
The framework aligns the construction principles of L4 with Unix philosophy. In line with Unix philosophy, Genode is a collection of small building blocks, out of which sophisticated systems can be composed. But unlike Unix, those building blocks include not only applications but also all classical OS functionalities including kernels, device drivers, file systems, and protocol stacks.
- Features
-
CPU architectures: x86 (32 and 64 bit), ARM (32 and 64 bit), RISC-V
-
Kernels: most members of the L4 family (NOVA, seL4, Fiasco.OC, OKL4 v2.1, L4ka::Pistachio, L4/Fiasco), Linux, and a custom kernel.
-
Virtualization: VirtualBox (on NOVA), a custom virtual machine monitor for ARM, and a custom runtime for Unix software
-
Over 100 ready-to-use components
Genode is open source and commercially supported by Genode Labs.

Thread 1:
I haven't seen the "This is how you use it as a daily driver" video yet.  Maybe it's lack of google-fu on my part?
If I can throw it on an inexpensive desktop, and the run Linux and Windows under it, and maybe do some Lazarus/Free pascal development, I'll be a happy camper.
  Reply 1: The "this is how you use it as a daily driver" would be for the sub project called SculptOS, you can find details on that and how to set it up here:

It’s capable of this today. Be aware that VMs do have a noticeable performance impact, but on a powerful system they aren’t unusably slow.
  Reply 4: Does this help? It‘s six years old though:

  Reply 5: It runs perfectly on refurbished Lenovo M910q tinies, with Kaby Lake Core i5-7500t or Core i7-7700t, 32GB Ram. But so does everything else.
Linux via their VirtualBox port works, usable with 32GB Ram. Didn't try Windows, though.
Thinking about it, the same should apply for most N150-based mini-pcs, because everything is intel inside. May have bad firmware/bios, though.

The “showcase” composition / implementation of Genode, Sculpt OS, is pretty fun to install and run.

Thread 3:
So good memories the day I obtained the floppy with Drops with dope. Awesomeness. One the same bunch, another floppy of a unixlike RT OS, which I cannot now recall the name to save my life...the then blackberry one.

Reminds me of T2 SDE:

Thread 5:
An active, long-running project, more than 20 years now, Genode is amazing outright.
They actually managed to make a general-purpose OS (Sculpt) with an architecture centered around capabilities, and they can run such a system with seL4 as the microkernel, which guarantees capabilities cannot be forged.
  Reply 1: They can use most L4-based microkernels, mostly their own, or NOVA or Fiasco. Secure capabilities are a feature of all L4 kernels.
  Reply 2: >They can use most L4-based microkernels, mostly their own, or NOVA or Fiasco.
Correct, Genode supports several kernels, including but not limited to those.
>Secure capabilities are a feature of all L4 kernels.
Not accurate. Liedtke's L4 does not do capabilities.
It would be more accurate to say that most modern L4-like kernels do.
The highlight is seL4, specifically because it offers those formal guarantees while also being the fastest.
  Reply 3: Who cares about formal guarantees when the other kernels are much better and provide a much better infrastructure. The kernel itself is minimal. Fiasco can be real-time.
  Reply 4: >Who cares about formal guarantees
Projection. You might not care, but extrapolating is a mistake.
Public as well as private sector with high assurance needs have gathered around seL4 foundation due to its proofs and technical excellence.
>are much better
Subjective. What is your criteria?
>Fiasco can be real-time.
Depends on your definition of real-time.
Hard realtime requires guarantees that the deadlines will always be met. The only non-toy kernel that offers proof of WCET is seL4.
If soft realtime is all you need, then Linux with PREEMPT_RT suffices.
  Reply 5: The private sector uses commercial L4 spinoffs, not an academic kernel.
