Article Content:
--------------------
Animals must have Wikipedia articles.
You have limited time, but get more time for each animal listed. When the timer runs out, that's game over.
No overlapping terms. For example, if you list “bear” and “polar bear”, you get no point (or time bonus) for the latter. But you can still get a point for a second kind of bear. Order doesn't matter.
Ignore the extraneous visuals. Focus on naming animals.

Thread 1:
Since this accepts all marine, freshwater and sky animals (birds) also this could take a very long time. For a bit more of a challenge in a shorter time list all animals starting with a particular letter. Time yourself a couple minutes to put some pressure on. Challenge your friends and family!

Thread 2:
One of the few sites with a fun "you have javascript turned off" message.
> This game requires JavaScript. Or, if you've superior taste, take out a pen and paper and start listing animals.
  Reply 1: I think that's meant to be a gentle insult, but I'm glad it had it's intended effect!

Thread 3:
I added Jellyfish and then Portuguese Man-o-war.
It took the man o war, but crossed out Jellyfish and said "added a vaguer term", but a jellyfish and a man-o-war are discrete animals.
The man-o-war is a colonial siphonophore composed of zooids, while a jellyfish is a singular marine organism.
They're both in the phylum Cnidaria, and that would have been a more vague term had I entered it.
  Reply 1: yeah there are lots of inaccuracies.
I added bobcat, then lynx, and it would not accept lynx because bobcat was there.
Oh, and, 77, just woke up. No coffee.
  Reply 2: To be fair, "lynx" can refer to either the Eurasian lynx
(Lynx lynx)
  specifically, or to the genus
Lynx
 and the four extant species in it (Eurasian lynx, Canada lynx, Iberian lynx, bobcat).
  Reply 3: Likewise, it wouldn't accept “panther” because “tiger” was already there:
> I assume you mean “panther” in the general sense of any big cat.
Why on Earth would it assume mean
that
, of all things, rather than “black panther”?  If it's gonna be pedantic about it, it could've complained about “leopard” and “jaguar” already being there (which they were) instead of complaining about an animal that nobody in their right mind would call a “panther”.

Thread 4:
Presumably inspired by this tweet:

  Reply 1: That and probably Sporcle. Name X from {group Y} is a very popular quiz archetype.

Thread 5:
For anyone wondering: This is based on basic text parsing and a key-value lookup table, no AI involved whatsoever.
Here's the table:

  Reply 1: There must be another table. I got "Are you Australian?" for "dingo" and for "cicada" "don't you love their songs?"

  Reply 2: Hmm, what's this one?
  var h = hash(guess);
  if (h==7182294905658010 || h==6344346315172974) { return "Adorable guess, but it's spelled “rosy”."; }


I'm guessing they're hashes for "<something> rosie" or "<something> rosey", but what?
  Reply 3: 7182294905658010  "rosey maple moth"
6344346315172974  "rose maple moth"
  Reply 4: Yea, there's a bunch of easter eggs. And then there's the table for the taxonomy tree.
  Reply 5: There's a long Indonesian string referencing "weasel" - weird
