My Google account has been suspended from GCP since March 2024.
I have submitted multiple appeals through ts-consult@google.com over 2 years. Every time I get the same automated template asking me to explain, I reply with details, then nothing. No human ever responds.
Case: #1-8622000037271
Timeline:
  - March 2024: Suspended, appeal submitted
  - April 2024: Automated requests for info, I replied
  - Nov 2024: More automated emails, I replied again
  - Dec 2024 - now: Complete silence
I am a CS researcher at UC Berkeley. This has seriously impacted my work.
Has anyone successfully gotten Google to review a GCP suspension appeal? How do you reach a human?

Thread 1:
I had my GCP quota algorithmically set to 0 after spending 6 months working with them to launch a startup.
I went through a ton of hoops to get approval for our quota. We sent them system diagrams, code samples, financial reports, growth predictions, etc. It was months of back and forth. I'll also add that it was very annoying because they auto-reject your quota request if you don't respond to their emails within 48 hours but their responses take 1-3 weeks. In any case, after 6 months, they eventually approved us for our quota, we launched, and they shut us down to 0 quota across all services the instant our production app got traffic.
We contacted them again asking for help. We never got any human response. We got a boiler plate template a few times, but that was it.
I will never ever ever again use a cloud service where I can't guarantee that I can get good customer service. Unfortunately for a small business that means no big clouds like AWS, GCP, etc.
Yes, I am bitter.
  Reply 1: Has AWS support gone downhill in the last two years?  I've worked with them in the past - as both an individual and a couple startups - I always reached a human.  Issues weren't always resolved as quickly as I'd like but response times were short.
  Reply 2: Working in small and medium businesses I've observed the same thing, and I've been quite satisfied with it. So I don't think it's really gone downhill, so GP's comment doesn't really resonate for me, but that isn't to negate their experience. Otoh I keep hearing horror stories about GCP and now I'm reluctant to try it.
  Reply 3: Shitting on GCP is just popular on HN and always gets upvoted. AWS and Azure have royally fucked thousands of customers if you care to search for those writeups. My wild ass guess, considering posts like these have zero background details, is that they were careless with service account keys and their account got suspended for mining crypto or something. They also probably weren’t actually
paying
 for support of any kind and that’s why no one is responding to them.
  Reply 4: Nope. We had been testing in our development and staging environments for months. We were deploying to production the exact same stack and we got our quota revoked within about an hour. We must have tripped some random thing. We have absolutely no idea what I could have been though.
  Reply 5: I have the same question. I always got human response after 24-48hours or after one round of messages (with an automated human or machine, not sure). But so far, across 3 accounts and a dozens of correspondence, I always got a human.

I would try to get help from your department. Somewhere within CS and CS-adjacent departments at Berkeley there’s likely to be someone with an official or unofficial connection to Google that can get you in touch with a human to at least clarify the situation.

Thread 3:
So much information is missing from this.
What Google account? Is it personal Gmail? Or your academic account? Are you using this for personal reasons or professional or commercial reasons? What kind of payment method is attached? What was your level of usage? Any idea why you were suspended initially?
Because it could be that Google is reviewing your appeal and simply shadow-denying it, and you haven't provided the right information to make it look legit. E.g. if they think you're a spammer or mining crypto or they think you're creating additional free accounts to use free credits, they're obviously not going to tell you what makes them think that.
But if this is for university-related work, and your university purchases IT+cloud services from Google (as they probably do), talk to your IT department so they can get you in touch with their institution-level support. Obviously, for the attached Google sales rep, the last thing they want is a CS researcher losing access to GCP.
  Reply 1: Also, why wait 2 years to take it public?

Thread 4:

Can I suggest a topic for your next research? "Cloud exascalers and their negative impact on the society"
  Reply 1: Or “Why I should have been paying for support if my entire career depended on it.”
  Reply 2: There are so many things with this statement I don't even know where to start. I hope you're being sarcastic.
  Reply 3: Not sure why this is getting downvoted. This may be snark, but this is 100% needed in the world we live in today. It is a fact of today's world that individuals have no leverage over these companies. I can understand why big companies, who have leverage, buy their services. But I don't understand why individuals, who have no leverage, buy their services and build their profession and livelihood around them. Any day, they can cut you off from their services. You are being irresponsible to yourself if you put all your eggs in these big tech baskets.
We seriously do need this kind of research and compelling articles that argue why relying on these big tech cloud services is harmful for individuals.

Thread 5:
The only reliable way to get things fixed with these large companies, is to have a direct point of contact to them. I have one. You can find my email in my profile, ping me and I will try to get a human in the loop for you.
