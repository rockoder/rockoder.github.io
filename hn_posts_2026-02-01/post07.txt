Update 30/01/26 – 12:50 pm (IST): In a statement to the folks over at Android Authority, Google confirmed that they’ve tweaked the platform experience to prevent non-Premium users from accessing background playback when using browsers.
Background playback is a feature intended to be exclusive for YouTube Premium members. While some non-Premium users may have previously been able to access this through mobile web browsers in certain scenarios, we have updated the experience to ensure consistency across all our platforms.
Original article published on January 28, 2026, follows:
It looks like YouTube has thrown a wrench into the works for a lot of mobile users who enjoy listening to videos with their screen off. Over the past few days, reports have been flooding in that the handy background video playback feature has suddenly stopped working on Samsung Internet.
Judging by the reports, it seems that the problem seems to have cropped up around a week ago and has since been impacting more users. While a majority of reports are coming from Samsung Internet users, it’s not the only browser impacted. Users on Brave, Vivaldi, and even Microsoft Edge have complained about the issue.
What’s happening is pretty specific. When users try to minimize the browser or turn off their screen, the audio cuts out. On Samsung devices, some users noticed a fleeting notification that said “MediaOngoingActivity” right before the media controls vanished entirely.
For years, people have relied on these mobile browser workarounds to get a free taste of what YouTube Premium offers: ad-free viewing and, crucially, background audio. This sudden, simultaneous failure across multiple browsers strongly suggests a targeted change by YouTube.
Samsung’s community forums and subs like r/oneui and r/youtube are becoming hubs to discuss the problem. Users have confirmed that basic troubleshooting tips, like ensuring that PiP mode and JavaScript are enabled, and also clearing the app’s cache, do not work.
Even the privacy-focused Brave browser has a new open issue on its GitHub page, confirming that the background play feature, which was working perfectly, has now failed. This widespread nature makes it hard to blame a single browser update or a simple bug.
That said, at least one Brave user claims that this problem was fixed, and it now works fine. So I’d suggest Brave users keep an eye out for any new updates and try again (the same goes for other browsers too).
While YouTube hasn’t officially commented, the consensus among users is that the company has finally closed a popular loophole, effectively breaking the YouTube Premium workaround for millions. If you’re searching for why your YouTube background play is not working, or your Samsung Internet background video issue is suddenly a problem, you’re definitely not alone.
If this isn’t a random glitch, then the move is a clear push to convert more users to a paid subscription, leaving those who relied on the feature to either pay up or keep their screens on. We’ve already reported on YouTube’s fresh crackdown on third-party clients like NewPipe. So it won’t be a stretch to assume that YouTube is indeed patching such workarounds.
It’s a tough break for anyone who used this trick to listen to podcasts or music videos on the go.

Thread 1:
Newpipe remains one of the best solutions for background playback. They do tend to move pretty quickly to patch "fixes" that YouTube throw in now and again. It's also useful for video backups if you need to preserve them for any reason.
  Reply 1: I'm a NewPipe user as well, unfortunately the experience is getting worse there too. Might be because I also use a VPN, but after every couple of videos I have to cooldown my usage until the IP block is reset.
This started happening for me a few weeks ago.
  Reply 2: I am using Tubular, a NewPipe fork that has built-in SponsorBlock and ReturnYouTubeDislike features.
  Reply 3: Tubular is great. Though they sometimes take a while to fix playback issues, like the one where videos only played for 10 seconds. That caused a bunch of forks to come out and I used those for a period of time.
Lately I discovered Firefox with background play and sponsor block extensions still work. If this stops working hopefully tubular will be a good backup.
  Reply 4: Why install additional software? Firefox hasn't broken for me only the Chrome clones.
  Reply 5: Because modern websites are unusable on mobile; it's a feature and not a bug.

Thread 2:
Background playback is a feature of the browser and operating system, not YouTube.
Consumer laws should prevent Google doing this. We need an anti-DMCA to make circumvention, bypassing, or disabling of user’s device or OS features illegal.
  Reply 1: Serving requests is a feature of Youtube and if they don't want to serve your client... well you didn't pay for it anyway.
  Reply 2: They corned the market, drove everyone out of it, and are now rent-seeking. Can't say you have much of a choice between youtube and any other video provider that has the same content on it.
  Reply 3: >They corned the market, drove everyone out of it, and are now rent-seeking.
It's almost dumping [1]: they gave a service away for free (even if they were losing a lot of money) just to make it unfeasible for any other company to start a competing service.
Vimeo could have been a competitor, but then they pivoted to a professional market and now that Bending Spoons bought them [2], I'm not sure they will even have a future.

  Reply 4: It is dumping. The whole YCombinator VC Silicon Valley model is entirely based on dumping. They call it "burning VC cash", which is an overly wordy synonym for it to muddy the waters, and it would be positive for the world if everyone installed a browser script that did a `s/burning vc cash/dumping` on all text elements.
  Reply 5: The equivalent here is if Sony owned the most watched TV network (by far) and decided that it would work fully on Sony Bravia tvs. People with LG or Samsung TV's could only watch a degraded version.

Thread 3:
This will be a positive if browsers (extensions?) allow the ability to spoof visibility by site. Most websites have no business knowing if they're in the foreground or background.
  Reply 1: That's actually quite easy. onBlur, etc
  Reply 2: Just to be precise, onBlur is a JavaScript event for an item that loses its focus, visibilitychange is what you actually need to detect tab changing.
  Reply 3: Nice - you’ve just increased significantly power consumption of your browser!
Browsers will “slow down” various aspects of pages when they’re not visible, like animations or timers, to save on battery usage on laptops or phones.
Even if your remove explicit APIs for backgrounding, pages can still use heuristics to detect anyway.
  Reply 4: The user should be making the choice - not the website. The website could be informed about being backgrounded, if the user chooses to. But the user should have the priority in the decision chain - their choice overrides any that the website makes.
That is what it means to have control over your own computing.
  Reply 5: >That is what it means to have control over your own computing.
Ah, see, there's the problem. The corpo apologists in the room don't want
you
 to have that. The hardware you bought; err, licensed; to them, is
their
 playground.

Thread 4:
Revanced allows you to patch the official Android YouTube apk to enable this feature alongside many others, including a block, Sponsorblock, and dislikes.

Rossmann's Grayjay app offers the same functionality in a separate standalone client. It has a paid pro mode, but is free software. I use this on devices that I haven't signed in with Google.

  Reply 1: The real reason why sideloading is soon to be blocked by Google, along with NewPipe.

Thread 5:
i had that happen on firefox mobile months ago and installed video background play fix which all it does is stop sending the js hooks for when tab/window focus is lost. it was something clearly targeted to mobile browsers for people like me who don't bother with official apps anymore as they're riddled with antipatterns and ads. you can just youtube to the homepage like it's an app anyway.
  Reply 1: +N for video background play fix extension. Highly recommended on firefox.
This and ubo on android really make firefox a really great (the best imo) browser on android.
