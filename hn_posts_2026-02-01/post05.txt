Article Content:
--------------------
Animals must have Wikipedia articles.
You have limited time, but get more time for each animal listed. When the timer runs out, that's game over.
No overlapping terms. For example, if you list “bear” and “polar bear”, you get no point (or time bonus) for the latter. But you can still get a point for a second kind of bear. Order doesn't matter.
Ignore the extraneous visuals. Focus on naming animals.

Thread 1:
One of the few sites with a fun "you have javascript turned off" message.
> This game requires JavaScript. Or, if you've superior taste, take out a pen and paper and start listing animals.
  Reply 1: I think that's meant to be a gentle insult, but I'm glad it had it's intended effect!

Thread 2:
I added Jellyfish and then Portuguese Man-o-war.
It took the man o war, but crossed out Jellyfish and said "added a vaguer term", but a jellyfish and a man-o-war are discrete animals.
The man-o-war is a colonial siphonophore composed of zooids, while a jellyfish is a singular marine organism.
They're both in the phylum Cnidaria, and that would have been a more vague term had I entered it.
  Reply 1: It raises the question: can a colony of individual animals (zooids in this case) that work cooperatively be called a singular animal itself? I think biologists say yes, but it’s an interesting taxonomic boundary.
  Reply 2: We think cows are singular animals, despite being made up of lots of different organisms with different DNA.  (Much of the diversity happening in the gut.)
  Reply 3: I suspect all mammals depend on colonies of gut flora to survive. Humans are no exception.
  Reply 4: I think the bacteria in your gut outnumber the human cells in your body.
  Reply 5: that's like saying tomato is a fruit
in biological journal, sure - for practical purposes straight up no
if it looks like a jellyfish, stings like a jellyfish and behaves like a jellyfish - then it doesn't matter what it looks like under a microscope, it is jellyfish

Thread 3:
Did anyone else have the thought of “should I just list off all the Ubuntu version names that I know and start with that”?

Thread 4:
Presumably inspired by this tweet:

  Reply 1: That and probably Sporcle. Name X from {group Y} is a very popular quiz archetype.

Thread 5:
For anyone wondering: This is based on basic text parsing and a key-value lookup table, no AI involved whatsoever.
Here's the table:

  Reply 1: There must be another table. I got "Are you Australian?" for "dingo" and for "cicada" "don't you love their songs?"
edit:

  Reply 2: Hmm, what's this one?
  var h = hash(guess);
  if (h==7182294905658010 || h==6344346315172974) { return "Adorable guess, but it's spelled “rosy”."; }


I'm guessing they're hashes for "<something> rosie" or "<something> rosey", but what?
  Reply 3: 7182294905658010  "rosey maple moth"
6344346315172974  "rose maple moth"
  Reply 4: Yea, there's a bunch of easter eggs. And then there's the table for the taxonomy tree.
  Reply 5: There's a long Indonesian string referencing "weasel" - weird
