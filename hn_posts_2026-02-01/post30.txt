Thread 1:
At first I thought "desktop shell" was supposed to be compositor, but that's not the case, a wayland compositor like sway is a requirement. I've been using sway for years I have no idea what a "shell" is? It's somewhere in between a desktop environment and a theme?
  Reply 1: Yes. It occupies the spot in the Sway tutorials that recommend you "waybar, fuzzel, tofi, [etc]" to fill out the necessities. Noctalia, DMS, and other Quickshell projects cover that void.

Thread 2:
Still using X11, so no Noctia for me. Patiently waiting for somebody/someone to get remote desktop on Wayland.
https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=481912
  Reply 1: You probably know this already, but the problem isn't remote desktop into a logged-in session (krdp supports this) but rather logging in remotely into a headless server without a local session running.  This is slightly more complicated because the login manager has to get involved and present its UI remotely.  This is what that bug is tracking.
If you're happy to use Gnome with GDM as the login manager, remote headless sessions are supported already with gnome-remote-desktop:
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-remote-desktop#headless...
.
  Reply 2: Personally, I am fine with starting sessions via ssh, don't need extra remote login.
  Reply 3: Depends on everybody needs obviously, but say you have your dev machine that is remote, and you want to connect to it from a laptop (for real-estate reason or just for working from everywhere you want), maybe you want everything on the same (remote) machine like browser, db, IDE, etc and access to it as a remote "desktop" not just an ssh session.
Of course cli tools would be enough for somebody who likes a full TUI dev environment (and for my own use cases that would be enough) but for some people I understand the need, and I feel it is a regression for them to not have it.
  Reply 4: This is something implemented by the compositor, so with KDE this may be addressed by the new Plasma Login Manager. GNOME already supports this.
  Reply 5: Isn't it great how we just keep reinventing the same old wheel over and over and over again?
A light weight, minimal window manager for Wayland! How nice! We already had a hundred of those for X11.

Thread 3:
Wow, Noctalia looks amazing! I'm especially excited about the automatic theme by background image, that means my live updating wallpaper also tweaks the theme :) super fun.
  Reply 1: That is exactly the only feature I would like to disable. (have custom theming already)
  Reply 2: Checkout the Settings panel, in the GitHub screencast this feature is shown in the there.

Thread 4:
I’ve been trying out both DMS and Noctalia in separate VMs this week (both on Niri.) I like them both. Noctalia seems a bit more refined out of the box. DMS is more customizable. I foresee both taking over from .dotfile packs (and maybe even Omarchy) as better ways to bootstrap a Nir or Hyprland.
