Article Content:
--------------------
Animals must have Wikipedia articles.
You have limited time, but get more time for each animal listed. When the timer runs out, that's game over.
No overlapping terms. For example, if you list “bear” and “polar bear”, you get no point (or time bonus) for the latter. But you can still get a point for a second kind of bear. Order doesn't matter.
Ignore the extraneous visuals. Focus on naming animals.

Thread 1:
One of the few sites with a fun "you have javascript turned off" message.
> This game requires JavaScript. Or, if you've superior taste, take out a pen and paper and start listing animals.
  Reply 1: I think that's meant to be a gentle insult, but I'm glad it had it's intended effect!

Thread 2:
I added Jellyfish and then Portuguese Man-o-war.
It took the man o war, but crossed out Jellyfish and said "added a vaguer term", but a jellyfish and a man-o-war are discrete animals.
The man-o-war is a colonial siphonophore composed of zooids, while a jellyfish is a singular marine organism.
They're both in the phylum Cnidaria, and that would have been a more vague term had I entered it.
  Reply 1: yeah there are lots of inaccuracies.
I added bobcat, then lynx, and it would not accept lynx because bobcat was there.
Oh, and, 77, just woke up. No coffee.

Thread 3:
Presumably inspired by this tweet:

  Reply 1: That and probably Sporcle. Name X from {group Y} is a very popular quiz archetype.

Lazy daisy:
  (async () => {
    for (c of 'red black white brown blue green yellow golden grey arctic mountain forest spotted striped'.split(' '))

      for (a of 'bear lion tiger wolf fox eagle shark whale snake frog cat dog horse bat rat mouse owl hawk duck crab ant bee spider deer penguin elephant rabbit'.split(' ')) {

        guessbox.value = c + ' ' + a;
        uncomment(); attempt();
        await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 75));
      }
  })();

Thread 5:
No LLMs is impressive. Also recognizes "drop bear". Well played.
  Reply 1: The Australian Museum recognises them also:
https://australian.museum/learn/animals/mammals/drop-bear/
Somewhat more impressively, it recognises bungarra .. although it stalls out and fails on other similar words for various local animals.
  Reply 2: Hahah in a moment of desperation I put “unicorn” which its response made me laugh out loud.
