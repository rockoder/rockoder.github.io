My Google account has been suspended from GCP since March 2024.
I have submitted multiple appeals through ts-consult@google.com over 2 years. Every time I get the same automated template asking me to explain, I reply with details, then nothing. No human ever responds.
Case: #1-8622000037271
Timeline:
  - March 2024: Suspended, appeal submitted
  - April 2024: Automated requests for info, I replied
  - Nov 2024: More automated emails, I replied again
  - Dec 2024 - now: Complete silence
I am a CS researcher at UC Berkeley. This has seriously impacted my work.
Has anyone successfully gotten Google to review a GCP suspension appeal? How do you reach a human?

Thread 1:
I had my GCP quota algorithmically set to 0 after spending 6 months working with them to launch a startup.
I went through a ton of hoops to get approval for our quota. We sent them system diagrams, code samples, financial reports, growth predictions, etc. It was months of back and forth. I'll also add that it was very annoying because they auto-reject your quota request if you don't respond to their emails within 48 hours but their responses take 1-3 weeks. In any case, after 6 months, they eventually approved us for our quota, we launched, and they shut us down to 0 quota across all services the instant our production app got traffic.
We contacted them again asking for help. We never got any human response. We got a boiler plate template a few times, but that was it.
I will never ever ever again use a cloud service where I can't guarantee that I can get good customer service. Unfortunately for a small business that means no big clouds like AWS, GCP, etc.
Yes, I am bitter.
  Reply 1: if you want best support (while staying with big cloud) then Microsoft is the best .
Azure has its flaws but Microsoft puts a lot of people and effort behind it . We are not that large but there are so many instances where Microsoft reps will come in call with our customers or their people working with common customers will help out etc.
AWS has a done a decent job of taking enterprise business seriously last 10 years.  you can get human support but generally they will charge you , I.e if better support you want you have to pay for premium support plans .
They are constrained unlike MS they don’t have non-cloud large enterprise business relationships for decades M365 or AD etc that helps with building the enterprise DNA.
In all three clouds it works best if you don’t buy directly, buy through a partner reseller , who both have the relationships to the CSP and have the people to work with you .
  Reply 2: Sorry, no.
MS is the same network were even their lead engineers answer "well, uhh create a new account and hope you're not banned", when it comes to fixing a illegitimate ban issue.
None of the biggies are good. None of them.
You're better off building your own data enter. Can't believe I'm saying that, but I am. And it doesnt have to be acres and MW and water cooled. It can be a 42U rack.
Hell, I'm a homeowner and have 27U rack with 10U full, battery backup, solar, fiber and a backup internet connection, and stuff.
A small business could easy do this and own the hardware and software to their enterprise. In fact, they probably should. Helps prevent rug pulls!
  Reply 3: Now I am curious what is the realistic price a business would expect to put down for a full rack. Say UPS, switch, 4-8U storage, and the rest CPU compute. Without entertaining GPUs, I bet you can get very respectably speced 1-2U servers for $5k a pop. So few hundred thousand probably gets you just an unbelievable amount of horsepower.
  Reply 4: Having run a small business on one of the big clouds for almost 10 years now building your own data center is insane advice.
>easy
Hell no
  Reply 5: Has AWS support gone downhill in the last two years?  I've worked with them in the past - as both an individual and a couple startups - I always reached a human.  Issues weren't always resolved as quickly as I'd like but response times were short.

I would try to get help from your department. Somewhere within CS and CS-adjacent departments at Berkeley there’s likely to be someone with an official or unofficial connection to Google that can get you in touch with a human to at least clarify the situation.

Thread 3:
So much information is missing from this.
What Google account? Is it personal Gmail? Or your academic account? Are you using this for personal reasons or professional or commercial reasons? What kind of payment method is attached? What was your level of usage? Any idea why you were suspended initially?
Because it could be that Google is reviewing your appeal and simply shadow-denying it, and you haven't provided the right information to make it look legit. E.g. if they think you're a spammer or mining crypto or they think you're creating additional free accounts to use free credits, they're obviously not going to tell you what makes them think that.
But if this is for university-related work, and your university purchases IT+cloud services from Google (as they probably do), talk to your IT department so they can get you in touch with their institution-level support. Obviously, for the attached Google sales rep, the last thing they want is a CS researcher losing access to GCP.
  Reply 1: Also, why wait 2 years to take it public?

Thread 4:

Can I suggest a topic for your next research? "Cloud exascalers and their negative impact on the society"
  Reply 1: Or “Why I should have been paying for support if my entire career depended on it.”
  Reply 2: There are so many things with this statement I don't even know where to start. I hope you're being sarcastic.
  Reply 3: Not sure why this is getting downvoted. This may be snark, but this is 100% needed in the world we live in today. It is a fact of today's world that individuals have no leverage over these companies. I can understand why big companies, who have leverage, buy their services. But I don't understand why individuals, who have no leverage, buy their services and build their profession and livelihood around them. Any day, they can cut you off from their services. You are being irresponsible to yourself if you put all your eggs in these big tech baskets.
We seriously do need this kind of research and compelling articles that argue why relying on these big tech cloud services is harmful for individuals.

Thread 5:
Unless you know someone at Google with a little swagger to get things done you’re shit out of luck.
  Reply 1: Our GCP account manager was always pretty good at solving these sorts of problems for us at my last company.
  Reply 2: The role of GCP is to help enterprises negotiate better deals out of Azure/AWS.
Why would anyone actually use it is beyond me...
