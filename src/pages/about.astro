      <p>
        My name is <strong>Ganesh Pagade</strong>. I work as a Senior Engineering Manager, currently based in Pune, India.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have spent most of my career building and operating backend and platform systems. Over time, my role shifted from writing code to building teams and operating mechanisms around them. Today, I focus on execution reliability, architectural direction, and helping engineers grow into technical leadership roles.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve worked across enterprise software, retail logistics, and large-scale commerce platforms, and have led distributed teams across India, Europe, and the US.
      </p>

      <p>
        I write occasionally, mostly to clarify my own thinking. Some articles appear on Baeldung and others here. Topics tend to circle around distributed systems, engineering leadership, and how software organizations actually function in practice rather than in presentations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Earlier in my career, I taught computer science courses for several years. Teaching forced me to understand systems more deeply than writing production code ever did, and that influence shows up in how I approach architecture and management.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of software, I read about cognition, decision making, and learning. Software engineering is, in many ways, applied organizational psychology with compilers.

      <h2>What is “rockoder”?</h2>

      <p>
        It is an old internet handle from my college days. Too much music, too much coding. It stayed.
