The prevailing anxiety around artificial intelligence is built on a simple, linear assumption: as AI becomes "smarter" than humans in more domains, it is assumed to replace human labor in those domains. This is the logic of **Absolute Advantage**. If a machine can write code faster, better, and cheaper than a human, the human is redundant.

However, the history of economic transition suggests a different pattern. Labor substitution is governed not by absolute advantage, but by **Comparative Advantage** and the persistence of **Human Bottlenecks**.

### The Absolute vs. Comparative Gap

The most common error in predicting AI job loss is focusing on the "tasks" an AI can do. If an AI can perform 90% of a software engineer's tasks, we assume we only need 10% of the engineers.

But this ignores the **Jevons Paradox**: as the efficiency of a resource increases, the total consumption of that resource often rises rather than falls. When it becomes 10x cheaper to produce a line of code, we don't just produce the same amount of software with fewer people; we find 100x more software that we suddenly want to build.

The limiting factor for software hasn't been the "intelligence" required to write it; it’s been the cost and friction of production. By lowering that cost, AI unlocks a latent, near-infinite demand for software that was previously uneconomical to create.

### The Bottleneck Theory of Intelligence

Even as AI capabilities reach superhuman levels, the real-world execution of any project remains tethered to **Human Bottlenecks**.

The world is run by humans who are inefficient, irritable, competitive, and governed by legacy systems. These aren't just "bugs" in the system; they are the structural constraints of reality. A "digital god" might be able to solve a complex theoretical problem in seconds, but it still has to wait for a human manager to approve the budget, a human lawyer to review the contract, and a human customer to decide they actually want the solution.

As the "intelligence" part of the production process becomes abundant and near-free, the value shifts entirely to the **scarce inputs**: judgment, preference-setting, and navigating the human-to-human bottlenecks that AI cannot solve by itself.

### The Cyborg Era and Its Risks

We are entering the "Cyborg Era," where the most productive unit of labor is the human-AI combination. In this regime, the human provides the "why" (preferences and constraints) and the AI provides the "how" (execution and optimization).

The risk of this transition isn't "mass unemployment"; it is **Skill Devaluation**. The competitive advantage of the "mechanical expert"—the person who was really good at the syntax, the data entry, or the memorized process—evaporates. The value shifts to the "context expert"—the person who understands the messy, human reality that the AI is trying to serve.

This creates a brutal disruption for individuals whose identity and income were tied to the mechanical parts of their craft. They aren't being replaced by "robots"; they are being outcompeted by humans who have effectively delegated their "intelligence" and focused entirely on their "judgment."

### The Asymptotic Replacement

Total labor substitution is a corner solution. It requires a world where human complementarity goes to zero—where there is literally nothing a human can do to improve the output of an AI.

While theoretically possible, we are approaching this world in an asymptotic way. The closer we get to "perfect" AI intelligence, the more precious and high-leverage the remaining human inputs become. The last 1% of human judgment in a production process often accounts for 99% of its final value.

The "avalanche" of job loss is a compelling narrative for driving clicks and subscriptions, but it fails to account for how humans actually organize labor. We don't just retire when things get efficient; we invent new, stranger things to do with the surplus.

The danger isn't that you won't have a job. The danger is that your job will change in ways that make your current skills irrelevant, while the world around you continues to feel just as busy, complex, and bottlenecked as ever.
