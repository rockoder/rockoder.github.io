Java 10 was released recently. I thought of covering new features in Java 10 on [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/). They liked the idea and we ended up creating a series of three articles. Here's the first one:  
[Java 10 LocalVariable Type-Inference](http://www.baeldung.com/java-10-local-variable-type-inference)

Hope you like it.

Also starting this article I would be getting the credit for the articles I write. Here is my author's profile page on [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/):
