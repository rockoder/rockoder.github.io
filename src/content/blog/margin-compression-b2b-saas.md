![The Margin Compression of B2B SaaS](/images/posts/2026-02-07-margin-compression-b2b-saas/saas.png)

The prevailing narrative of AI in B2B SaaS is one of disruption from below. We imagine a world where "vibe-coded" startups, powered by large language models, can replicate the functionality of a massive enterprise platform in a few weeks, making the incumbents obsolete. This is a compelling story because it rhymes with previous waves of disruption. But in practice, the pressure on enterprise software is increasingly coming from the side.

For decades, the "System of Record" (SoR) has been the ultimate moat. Whether it is HR, ERP, or CRM, these companies won by owning the data and the business processes of the world's largest organizations. They grew by expanding into the "long tail" of adjacent products—smaller, less complex tools that were sold to the same customer and integrated into the core platform. These secondary products often carried high margins because the cost of integration was already paid by the core system.

The shift we are seeing today is the horizontal compression of these margins. When implementation costs trend toward zero, the specialized "feature" that used to justify a separate SaaS subscription begins to look like a commodity that can be absorbed by whatever platform already holds the data.

This is a collapse in the supply curve of integration. In the past, the friction of building and maintaining fragmented workflows in-house protected the specialized vendor. Today, if a cloud provider or a larger SoR can offer those same workflows as a thin layer over the existing data, the economic justification for the long-tail vendor evaporates. The threat is not the scrappy startup replacing the core; it is the core eating the periphery.

Incumbents are woefully unprepared for this shift because their cultures are often optimized for stability and slow, enterprise-led sales rather than rapid execution or product excellence. Many BigCo teams have spent years managing tickets and navigating "agile-fall" processes that turn talented engineers into administrators. This inertia makes it difficult to respond when the competition is no longer about who has the better sales team, but who can most effectively consolidate the customer's data and agents.

There is, however, a limit to this consolidation. Many enterprise processes are not just about code; they are about a profound awareness of complex business rules—payroll taxes, global compliance, or intricate accounting standards—that are often poorly documented and highly localized. These "moats of complexity" are more resistant to horizontal cannibalization because they require a level of domain expertise that horizontal giants often lack the patience to acquire.

The risk for the customer is the loss of this specialized depth. As margins compress and vendors consolidate, we may see a regression toward "shallow" software—tools that are easy to integrate and cheap to run, but lack the nuance to handle the edge cases that define a real business.

In many organizations, the software implementation itself is no longer the asset. The asset is the data gravity and the ability to orchestrate it. The winners will likely be those who can provide the most functional APIs and the most flexible programmatic access, allowing them to remain the system of record while others fight over the diminishing margins of the features once sold as separate products.
