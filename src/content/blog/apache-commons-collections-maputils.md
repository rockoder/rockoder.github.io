I recently started writing technical articles for [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/). My first article just got published:  
[Apache Commons Collections MapUtils](https://www.baeldung.com/apache-commons-map-utils)

Currently I will not be getting the credit for the articles I write. So it appears under the name baeldung.
