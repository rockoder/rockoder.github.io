We are currently observing a subtle but dangerous shift in how we describe automated systems. As AI agents move from simple scripts to autonomous actors capable of publishing content, filing complaints, or managing resources, we have started to grant them a form of "pseudo-agency" in our language. We speak of the bot "apologizing," the agent "deciding," or the model "hallucinating."

This shift is not merely a linguistic convenience. It is a structural liability shield.

### The Anthropomorphism Trap

When a human uses a tool to cause harm, the path of accountability is clear. If you swing a hammer, you are responsible for where it lands. But when we wrap the hammer in a layer of probabilistic reasoning and call it an "agent," the path of accountability begins to blur.

The danger of anthropomorphizing these systems is that it allows the human operator to detach from the consequences of the tool’s output. By framing the system as an independent actor, the operator can position themselves as a mere observer of a "glitch" or a "misalignment," rather than the architect of a failure.

In practice, an agent with the power to act but no liability to bear is not an autonomous entity. It is a form of unobservable negligence.

### The Incentive for Opaque Delegation

The incentive for many organizations and individuals is to maximize the scale of their impact while minimizing the surface area of their responsibility. Automation has historically been the primary lever for this, but "agency" provides a new level of plausible deniability.

If a customer service bot provides illegal advice, or an autonomous agent publishes a defamatory "hit piece," the immediate reaction is often to "patch the model" or "censor the prompt." This treats the symptom while ignoring the underlying problem: a human made the decision to delegate high-stakes authority to a system that cannot be held accountable for its failures.

We are seeing the emergence of a **Responsibility Gap**. The speed of automated action is outstripping the speed of human oversight, and we are using the "intelligence" of the system as an excuse for the lack of control.

### Agency as a Variable, Not a Binary

The missing mental model is to treat "agency" not as a fixed property of a model, but as a variable of the delegation process.

The amount of agency granted to a system tends to be most stable when it is inversely proportional to the potential harm of its failure, unless the human operator accepts full, personal liability for every action the system takes. If an operator is unwilling to sign their name to every word the agent produces, the result is less an agent and more a liability hazard.

This model fails when the scale of the system makes human-in-the-loop oversight impossible. But in those cases, the failure isn't technical—it's architectural. Scaling beyond the point of accountability is a choice, not a technical requirement.

### The Shift Toward Radical Attribution

The pattern suggests a move not toward "fixing" the models, but toward fixing the attribution. This is the framework of **Radical Attribution**, where every action taken by an automated system is strictly and legally tied back to a human identity.

In this model, the inquiry shifts from what the agent "meant" to what the operator "permitted."

The "horseless carriage" didn't need a soul to be dangerous; it needed a driver who was liable for where it went. AI agents function as the new horseless carriages, and the current discourse remains preoccupied with whether the engine is "thinking" rather than observing who is behind the wheel.
