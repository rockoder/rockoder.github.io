In modern software repositories, we are beginning to see a new convention: the `AGENTS.md` file. It’s a specialized manifest designed to keep AI agents from drifting. It defines the "vibe," the constraints, and the non-negotiables of a codebase. It acknowledges a simple truth: without explicit instruction, any autonomous system will eventually optimize for the wrong thing.

We have reached a point where we treat our tools with more architectural rigor than we treat ourselves.

### The Real Problem: The Drift of the Unrecorded Self

Most of us believe our "values" are stable. We think we know what we stand for. But in reality, human behavior is a rolling average of our last five major decisions, heavily weighted by our current stress levels and environmental pressures.

Without a written set of principles, we are subject to **Decision Drift**. We trade long-term reputation for short-term leverage not because we are "bad" people, but because we lack a stable, high-latency anchor to counteract the high-frequency noise of daily life. We aren't failing our principles; we simply don't have a manifest to check our actions against.

### Why This Exists: The Myth of Inherent Consistency

We avoid documenting our personal "specs" because we want to believe that integrity is an innate quality—something you either have or you don't. We find the idea of a "personal protocol" cold or robotic.

But biological memory is a lossy storage system. It is optimized for survival, not consistency. When you are tired, hungry, or afraid, your "intuitive" principles are the first things to be compressed out of existence. We rely on "gut feeling" because it’s fast, but your gut has no version history. It cannot tell you how your current decision contradicts the person you were three years ago.

### The Missing Model: The Personal Protocol (HUMANS.md)

The missing model is the **Version-Controlled Manifest for the Self**.

A `HUMANS.md` is not a diary, a list of goals, or a bucket list. It is a technical specification for your character. It is a document you pull up when a decision feels "gray" to see if it violates the invariants you defined when you were thinking clearly.

| Component | Purpose | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Invariants** | Non-negotiable boundaries. | "I do not speak ill of people who aren't in the room." |
| **Mental Models** | Default filters for reality. | "Apply Hanlon’s Razor to all interpersonal friction." |
| **Decision Gates** | Protocols for high-stakes choices. | "If it isn't a 'Hell Yes,' it is a 'No'." |
| **Bug Fixes** | Lessons learned from past failures. | "Never send a reactive email after 9:00 PM." |

### Tradeoffs and Failure Modes

A personal protocol is a tool, and like any tool, it can be misused.

1.  **The Trap of Rigidity:** A protocol that cannot evolve becomes a prison. You must allow for "pull requests" to your own soul as life teaches you new lessons. If you find your manifest is consistently at odds with reality, you are either failing the manifest or the manifest is failing you.
2.  **Performative Virtue:** It is easy to write down who you *wish* you were. A `HUMANS.md` is only useful if it accounts for your specific "bugs"—the unique ways you tend to fail.
3.  **The Optimization Paradox:** You can spend so much time refining your principles that you forget to live them. The goal is to reduce cognitive load, not to create a new form of analysis paralysis.

### Second-Order Effects: Principled Compounding

The second-order effect of a personal protocol is the **Restoration of Focus**.

When your principles are explicit and version-controlled, you stop wasting energy on "meta-decisions." You don't have to decide to be honest every time it’s hard; you decided once in the manifest, and now you just execute the protocol.

Over decades, this creates **Principled Compounding**. Your life stops being a series of reactive corrections and starts being a deterministic result of your manifest. You become a person who is "reliable" not because you have a special gift, but because you have a better operating system.

We are entering an era where the most successful humans will be those who can explicitly define their own constraints. If you don't write your own `HUMANS.md`, the world will happily write one for you—and you probably won't like the specs.
