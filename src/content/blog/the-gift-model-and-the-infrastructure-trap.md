The most persistent tension in open source software is not about code, licenses, or security. It is about a fundamental disagreement on the nature of the relationship between those who build and those who consume.

On one side, we have the **Gift Model**. This is the view that open sourcing code is an act of voluntary generosity. The creator gives a "gift" to the world, governed by a license that defines how it can be used, but carrying no social or moral obligations beyond that. In this model, the user is entitled to exactly what is in the repository—nothing more. No documentation, no support, no responsiveness, and certainly no seat at the table.

On the other side, we have the **Infrastructure Model**. This is the view that once a project reaches a certain level of adoption, it ceases to be a "personal project" and becomes "public infrastructure." In this model, the project belongs to the community that relies on it. The creator is no longer just a generous inventor; they are a public servant with a duty of care, responsiveness, and democratic governance.

### The Source of Friction: Entitlement Mismatch

Most of the "drama" in open source communities arises when a user operating in the Infrastructure Model encounters a creator operating in the Gift Model.

The user feels entitled to basic courtesy, clear documentation, and timely bug fixes because they see the software as a critical utility. The creator feels besieged by demands for free labor because they see the software as a no-strings-attached gift they happen to have made public.

This is a **Conceptual Gap** that cannot be bridged by "better communication" or "community managers." It is a structural conflict of incentives.

### The Illusion of Community

We often use the word "community" to bridge this gap, but the word itself is overloaded. To a creator, "community" often means a group of peers who contribute back to the project. To a user, "community" often means a support network they can lean on.

When a project is young, these definitions overlap. But as a project scales, the number of "takers" often outpaces the number of "givers." The "community" stops being a group of collaborators and starts being a customer base that doesn't pay.

For the creator, this shift is often experienced as **Morale Erosion**. They started by sharing something they loved and ended up running a high-stress, unpaid service business for thousands of people they don't know.

### The Risks of the Infrastructure Model

The risk of the Infrastructure Model is that it creates a **Tragedy of the Commons** for human attention. By treating every maintainer as a public utility, we create an environment where the most talented creators are the ones most likely to burn out or withdraw.

When expectations require that maintainers respond to every bug report or document every edge case, the effect is a tax on the very generosity that made the software possible. The inventor is pressured to become a professional support engineer, often for companies with a market cap billions of times larger than the maintainer’s bank account.

### Respecting the Gift

The path to a more sustainable open source ecosystem is not to force Gift Model creators to become Infrastructure Model maintainers. It is to accept that **not all open source is a community project.**

Some software is just a gift. You get the code, you get the rights, and you get nothing else.

If a business or life depends on a project, the responsibility for its maintenance, documentation, and support tends to lie with the consumer, not the person who provided the gift. In this light, the user functions as the vendor of their own infrastructure.

When maintainers are viewed as generous volunteers rather than unpaid employees, the entitlement gap begins to close. The requirement is not necessarily "democratic governance" for every library, but a clearer understanding of what is actually being granted: the source code, and the right to walk away.
