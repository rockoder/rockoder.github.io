The economics of software have historically been defined by the high cost of implementation. Building a functional, reliable application required a specific set of rare skills and a significant investment of time. Consequently, the market evolved toward "packaged" software—SaaS platforms that spread the cost of implementation across thousands of users by offering a standardized set of features.

We pay for subscriptions not just for the code, but for the normalization of decisions. A project management tool is a collection of opinions about how tasks should be structured, how priorities should be assigned, and how teams should communicate. When a company adopts a specific SaaS, they are buying a pre-made operational ontology.

As implementation costs drop toward zero, the primary justification for standardized software begins to erode. If a custom tool can be generated for the cost of a few tokens, the "feature gap" that once protected large platforms disappears. The individual can have a grocery app that exactly mirrors their store's layout, or a developer can have a personal CRM that matches their specific networking habits.

However, this shift toward infinite customization reveals a paradox. While the cost of implementation is falling, the cost of judgment remains constant.

Standardized software provides a "default reality." When a team uses a common tool, they don't have to debate the data model or the workflow; it is provided for them. In a world of perfectly tailored, AI-generated apps, every user becomes a product manager. Every minor preference requires a decision, and every decision carries a cognitive load.

There is a tendency to view "customization" as an unalloyed good. But in practice, most users do not want to design their own systems; they want their problems to disappear. The value of a subscription shifts from "access to features" to "relief from decisions."

We may see a bifurcation in the software market. On one side, a flood of "disposable" apps—single-use tools built to solve a hyper-specific, fleeting problem. On the other, a reinforcement of platforms that offer not just functionality, but a shared language and a curated set of constraints.

The competitive advantage of established software has seldom truly been the code itself. It has been the institutionalization of a specific way of working. AI can clone the implementation, but it cannot easily clone the social consensus that makes a standardized tool valuable.
