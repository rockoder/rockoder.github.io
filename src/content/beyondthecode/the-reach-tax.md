In a creation-limited era, the filter is skill. When producing a functional software product or a coherent essay requires months of concentrated effort, the mere existence of the output serves as a signal of intent and capability. The "moat" in such an environment is the difficulty of the work itself.

As generative tools reduce the marginal cost of production toward zero, this filter dissolves. The market transitions from a state of creation-limited scarcity to distribution-limited abundance. In this new dynamic, the quality of an individual artifact becomes secondary to the existing reach of its creator.

This shift introduces what might be called the Reach Tax. In a distribution-limited market, a new entrant often faces threshold effects that are non-linear. Below a certain level of existing attention or capital, even high-quality work can remain statistically invisible, drowned out by the sheer volume of low-cost alternatives. Above that threshold, reach becomes gravitational—it accumulates without the need for constant reinvestment, as existing nodes in the network find and amplify the work.

The consequence for early-stage founders and independent creators is a fundamental change in risk profile. Where once the primary risk was technical (can we build it?), the primary risk is now structural (can we afford to be seen?). Organizations with established distribution channels find their advantage compounded, as they can ship incremental or even mediocre improvements into a captive audience, while superior but unfunded alternatives fail to reach the threshold of awareness.

This dynamic tends to reward capital over craftsmanship. When creation is commoditized, the "moat" moves to where the friction remains. In 2026, the friction is not in the pixels or the prose, but in the finite attention of a human audience.
