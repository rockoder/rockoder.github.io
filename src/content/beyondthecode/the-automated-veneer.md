Large engineering organizations do not run on code; they run on the *legibility* of code. To a manager three layers removed from the codebase, "progress" is a series of artifacts: Jira tickets moving to the right, green boxes on a CI dashboard, PR descriptions, and quarterly OKR updates. These are the signals that allow the organization to feel like a scientific, data-driven machine.

AI has not just accelerated the production of code; it has accelerated the production of the veneer that surrounds it.

## The Mirage of Velocity

In a manual environment, the friction of writing documentation, status reports, and ticket updates serves as a natural throttle. It forces a certain level of synchronization between the work being done and the reporting of that work. Because it is tedious to lie with data, the reports tend to roughly approximate reality.

With AI, the cost of generating these signals has dropped to near zero. An engineer can now generate a detailed PR description, a technical design document, and a status update in seconds. The organization sees an explosion in "velocity." Tickets are closed faster, more documentation is produced, and dashboards look healthier than ever.

However, this is often a form of velocity inflation. When the signals of work become decoupled from the effort of work, they cease to be reliable indicators of progress. The organization becomes hyper-legible on paper while becoming increasingly opaque in practice.

## The Scientific Performance

The desire for "statistical control" and "data-driven management" often results in a performance rather than a practice. Management layers crave metrics because metrics provide the illusion of control over a chaotic system. AI is the perfect tool for this performance. It can generate the "numbers" and the "narratives" that management wants to see, formatted exactly as they expect to see them.

When every team is 10x more "productive" according to their dashboards, but the product feels just as brittle and the features take just as long to actually reach a customer, the gap is filled with the automated veneer. The metrics are "correct," but they are no longer meaningful. They have been optimized for the system’s need for legibility rather than the product’s need for quality.

## The Second-Order Opacity

The irony of the automated veneer is that it makes the organization harder to manage, not easier. As the volume of legible artifacts increases, the signal-to-noise ratio plummets. A Director cannot possibly read the thousands of AI-generated pages of documentation or the hundreds of AI-summarized status reports.

They end up relying on *further* layers of AI to summarize the summaries, creating a recursive loop of abstraction. At each step, the connection to the actual engineering reality—the "scar tissue" of the codebase—is thinned. The organization moves faster and faster toward a destination that fewer and fewer people actually understand.
