Disagreements regarding the utility of AI in engineering are rarely about the technology itself. Instead, they often reflect the participant's position within the organizational structure. For those who own the outcomes—executives and directors—AI is viewed as a force multiplier. For those who own the labor—individual contributors—it is often experienced as a force compressor.

This distinction is rooted in the ownership of leverage. From a management perspective, automation allows for a partial replacement of labor with capital. If an organization can achieve the same output with a smaller workforce, the share of value captured by the organization increases. The narrative of massive productivity gains is often a message directed at the allocators of capital, promising a world where the necessity of specialized labor is minimized.

For the individual contributor, the value of expertise is traditionally tied to its scarcity. When a model can simulate mastery over a wide range of technical domains, the perceived value of that expertise begins to commoditize. The effort required to differentiate oneself through technical depth alone feels increasingly futile. The worker observes a system that compresses their unique contribution into a replaceable set of instructions.

This creates a structural tension that is often misdiagnosed as a skills gap. The anxiety is not about an inability to use the tools, but about the shift in who captures the gains. In a world where technical artifacts become trivial to produce, the value shifts toward marketing, distribution, and strategic judgment.

The mental model of Judgment Capital vs Output Capital explains why this tension persists. Staff-level engineers who have spent decades building judgment find themselves in an environment that is currently intoxicated by output volume. While a manager may see a way to inflate the team's impact, the engineer sees a system that is losing its ability to recognize and value deep expertise.

The second-order effect is a hollowing out of technical authority. As the middle of the engineering hierarchy is commoditized, the gap between the orchestrators and the decision-makers widens. The argument that automation elevates all practitioners to a senior level fails when generalized. If seniority is granted by the tool rather than the person, the designation loses its organizational weight, and the hierarchy is driven to find new ways to gate-keep power.

In practice, optimism regarding these shifts is often a function of organizational security. Those who operate at a level where their judgment is already seen as capital can afford to view the technology as a liberation. Those whose livelihood depends on the scarcity of their specific technical output see a system designed to eliminate that scarcity. The conflict is not about the intelligence of the models, but about the incentives of the organization.
