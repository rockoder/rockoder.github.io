<p class="drop-cap">A Director of Product recently complimented a Senior Engineer on the 'professionalism' of his latest architectural proposal. The document was clean, perfectly formatted, and devoid of the technical jargon that usually peppered his drafts.</p>

What the Director perceived as "professionalism" was actually the result of **semantic ablation**. The engineer had used an LLM to "polish" his jagged, precise thoughts into a smoother, more legible form. In the process, the unconventional metaphors that described the system's true constraints were replaced by dead, safe clichés. The "jagged edges"—the points of highest insight—had been worn away to satisfy a statistical mean.

**Prose has become a JPEG of thought: visually coherent but stripped of its original data density.**

## The Legibility Trap

Organizations favor legibility. A document that "reads well" is easier to process in a calibration meeting or a budget approval cycle. It signals competence and alignment. Historically, achieving this level of "polish" required a high degree of cognitive effort and domain expertise. The quality of the prose was a reliable proxy for the quality of the thinking.

AI-assisted writing breaks this proxy. It allows for the production of "polished" artifacts with minimal cognitive engagement. The result is a "civilizational race to the middle," where the complexity of engineering thought is sacrificed on the altar of algorithmic smoothness.

When an engineer uses AI to "refine" their draft, the model gravitates toward the center of its training distribution. It identifies high-entropy clusters—the precise points where unique insights reside—and systematically replaces them with the most probable, generic token sequences. The resulting output is "standardized" for readability but intellectually hollowed out.

## Professionalism as a Class Marker

In corporate engineering systems, "good writing" is often treated as a class marker. It separates the "raw" engineer from the "leadership-ready" leader. Many engineers, particularly those for whom English is a second language or who lack formal liberal arts training, use AI to erase their linguistic "friction."

They are seeking to bypass the social penalty associated with "unpolished" communication. This is a rational response to an incentive structure that rewards presentation as much as substance. However, when an entire organization begins to use these tools, the "standard" for communication shifts.

**The "AI voice" becomes the default language of the corporation.**

Performance reviews and promotion packets are increasingly written in this frictionless register. The "jagged" account of a difficult project—the one that mentions the 3 AM debugging session and the specific, ugly trade-offs made—is ablated into a "successful delivery of a complex initiative through cross-functional collaboration." The signal is lost in the service of the template.

## The Disagreement: Efficiency vs. Intent

The disagreement here is between two actors with conflicting incentives.

The Engineering Manager wants **Efficiency**. They have forty performance reviews to write and two hundred Slack messages to process. They want information that is easy to skim and requires zero interpretation. To them, the "smooth" AI output is a productivity win. It reduces the "friction" of their day.

The Staff Engineer, however, needs **Intent**. They know that the "jagged edges" of a technical discussion are where the most important information lives. They recognize that a "polished" report often obscures the very risks that will cause an incident next month. To them, semantic ablation is a form of silent data loss. They worry that by making everything "readable," they are making the organization "blind" to complexity.

## The Observable Prediction: The Inversion of Trust

As "polished" output becomes cheap and ubiquitous, a reversal of trust will occur.

Previously, a well-written document earned trust. In the AI era, **a perfectly "smooth" document will begin to signal low effort**. The presence of "friction"—unorthodox phrasing, visceral metaphors, or even slight linguistic jaggedness—will become the new signal of high-entropy, human-led thought.

Organizations will find themselves in a paradox: they will continue to demand "polished" artifacts for their formal systems (promotions, QBRs) while privately trusting only the "unfiltered" conversations that happen outside those systems. The formal record of the organization will become a sea of ablated text, disconnected from the jagged reality of the work.

## Acknowledge the Model's Failure

This model assumes that "jagged" prose is always a signal of better thinking. This is not always true. Much human writing is jagged simply because it is incoherent or lazy. AI "polishing" can genuinely improve the clarity of a poorly expressed but valid idea.

Furthermore, in many corporate contexts—standardized status updates, HR policy announcements, or routine ticket descriptions—the "mean" is exactly what is required. In these cases, semantic ablation is not a loss; it is a successful removal of irrelevant noise. The danger lies not in the tool itself, but in the failure to distinguish between tasks that require "smoothness" and those that require "blood."
