Here is the list of thing, big or small that I did or changed in my day to day life after reading a book.

| Sr. No. | Book                 | Change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Impact/Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 1       | Your Brain at Work   |  Aggressively disabled any notification that would interrupt me: 1. Disabled email notification in Outlook emails at work 2. Disabled all WhatsApp notifications 3. Aggressively block unwanted callers 4. Aggressively disabled mobile app notifications | Do not get interrupted. As a knowledge worked it is very important to guard from unwanted interruptions.                                                                                                                                   |
| 2.      | The Last Lecture     | Cut the unwanted call while you are talking instead of the other person talking.                                                                                                                                                                          | Faster to get rid of unwanted to call without being cruel.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3.      | Naval                | Removed the hard restriction on self to complete the book before moving to another book                                                                                                                                                                   | This restriction has kept me from reading the next book I was ready to read. I was stuck in one book till no end. Helped me to read some very good books which I would not have reached while being stuck in completing the previous book. |
| 4.      | Brain Rules          | Stopped beating myself for not waking up early in the morning, for sleeping too much. Stopped trying to sleep only 7 hours. Started sleeping more hours without any guilt.                                                                                | Started being fresh throughout the day.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 5.      | Sapiens              | Paused self to think about impact of what I am thinking from evolution point of view. Started thinking 10,000 years beyond. Remind self that universe will not even notice if the earth is destroyed today.                                               | Helps to assign correct importance to things and not to take them too seriously.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6.      | Some TED Talk        | In Office, while sitting on chair during meetings, increase the height of the chair as much as I can possibly be comfortable, to look taller than I am.                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 9.      | Your Brain at Work   | Do not try to multi-task. Especially multiple mental tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 10.     | Read somewhere       | Premortem - What could be the reason of this project to fail in future. Think about what mistake am I making now which I will be costly. What I am not doing  that I should be doing?                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
