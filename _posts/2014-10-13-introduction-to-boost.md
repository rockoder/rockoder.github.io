Recently I gave hands-on Introduction to Boost in [C++ Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Pune-Cpp-and-Boost-Meetup/events/208409722/) held in Pune. The session went pretty well with 20-25 folks attending it on a Saturday morning.

I covered three Boost libraries:

1. Lexical Cast
1. Optional
1. Any

I had intentionally selected header-only libraries so that the audience could start coding along with me without having to build the Boost.

Here are the slides that I had prepared:

I have also uploaded the code generated during the live coding session:
