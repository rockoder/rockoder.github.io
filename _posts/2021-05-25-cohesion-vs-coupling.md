My new article on [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/) after a long time:
[Difference Between Cohesion and Coupling](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/cohesion-vs-coupling)

A simple but important topic especially in the era of microservices where getting wrong cohesion and coupling can cost you dearly. Me and my editor tried to keep things simples and I also added few diagrams to ease the understanding.

What do you think?
