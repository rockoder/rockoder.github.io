My next article on [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/):
[Priority-based Job Scheduling in Java](http://www.baeldung.com/java-priority-job-schedule)

I recently wanted to implement priority-based job scheduling at work. After completing my implementation, I thought it would be a good topic for a blog post. I suggested it to Baeldung and they accepted it. Hope you find it useful.
