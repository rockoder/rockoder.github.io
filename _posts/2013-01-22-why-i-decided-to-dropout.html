<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Yesterday I communicated that I will be dropping out of BITS-Pilani MS (Computer Science) program which was&nbsp;sponsored&nbsp;by my employer and conducted in office premises every&nbsp;Saturday.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I already have a post graduate (M.Sc.) degree in Computer Science from University of Pune. Then why was I motivated to enroll to the MS program? Primarily to update my knowledge with latest technologies and brush up some of my basics in Algorithms, DS and OS. Secondary motivation&nbsp;of-course&nbsp;was to add one more degree to my resume.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Unfortunately even after begin topper in Algorithms class (with 97 out of 100) I never really learnt anything. The syllabus was way too primitive and too little. Other subjects were equally disappointing. After mid&nbsp;semester&nbsp;I had already stopped attending the lectures. I was not getting value for my time.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I learnt one subject though - Network Programming. I didn't have this subject for M.Sc. It was really challenging and fun to study. But the credit goes to the book that was used for the course -&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Richard Stevens and not to the faculty. I read the book and loved it. I didn't attend the lectures but read most of the syllabus.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I completed first semester and stood second in the class. Final grades will be distributed&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; text-align: left;">soon</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; text-align: left;">. But I didn't enroll for second semester. If I am going to learn through self study, I might as well save time in other formalities. Why waste time attending lectures and giving exams which don't lead to my goal?</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">But there is one more reason for dropping out. I want to focus more on my startup. I want to learn things that are useful for my startup. With day job filling all my weekdays, I can't waste my weekends doing something that is not going to contribute towards my startup. If I giving it a shot I might as well give my best.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The decision was not easy. I am going to miss few opportunities the course had to offer after completion. One being qualifying for Ph.D.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I have&nbsp;unnecessarily&nbsp;increased the opportunity cost of my startup. Time will tell if I made the right decision.</span></span></div></div>
