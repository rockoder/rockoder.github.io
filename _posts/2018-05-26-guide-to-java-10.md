Here's the final article from the Java 10 series that I wrote for [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/):  
[Guide to Java 10](http://www.baeldung.com/java-10-overview)

Below are the other two articles published under this series:  
1. [Java 10 LocalVariable Type-Inference](http://www.baeldung.com/java-10-local-variable-type-inference)  
1. [Java 10 Performance Improvements](http://www.baeldung.com/java-10-performance-improvements)  

Hope you enjoy reading this series as much I enjoyed studying and writing about Java 10.
