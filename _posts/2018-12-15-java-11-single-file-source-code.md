Java 11 was released recently. Like my [series of articles on Java 10](http://www.baeldung.com/java-10-overview), at Baeldung we decided to cover important Java 11 features through multiple articles. 

Here is the first such article in which I talk about how we can run Java code as a script file. Yes, you read that right! More details here:

What do you think? Will it be useful for beginners?
