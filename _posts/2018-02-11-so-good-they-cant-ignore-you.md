Recently I completed reading [So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455509124/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1455509124&linkCode=as2&tag=rockoder-20&linkId=55eb1b99d891cd64e15ab00bd09a9e87). I wanted to write a summary of the book so that I could refer to it as and when required. I ended up creating a flow chart instead:
