The recent buzz around "vibecoding"—the idea of using AI agents to build entire systems without ever looking at the source code—has sparked a predictable divide between the "Serious Engineers" and the "Agent Optimists." But while the debate centers on whether agents are "ready for production," it misses the most important systemic shift: **the shift from writing logic to owning it.**

The boast "I’ve never seen the code" is not a sign of progress; it is a sign of a logic-sovereignty gap.

As someone who values the "Richard Stevens" approach to learning, I find the idea of 100% vibe-coding both fascinating and dangerous. It is fascinating because the cost of building a proof-of-concept has effectively dropped to zero. But it is dangerous because code is just an encoding of intent, and if you don't understand the encoding, you don't truly control the intent.

Here is how we should think about the "Agentic Era" of software:

1. **Design is the New Implementation**: In a world where implementation is cheap, the bottleneck moves upstream. Being an engineer used to mean knowing *how* to build; now it means knowing exactly *what* needs to be built and *why*. If your design is brittle, your agents will build a monument to that brittleness at 10x the speed of a human.
2. **Vibe Coding as a Technical Debt Credit Card**: Vibe-coding is like a high-interest credit card for developers. It allows you to accrue massive amounts of technical debt to get a product to market today. This is a valid strategy for a startup in the "find-market-fit" stage. But eventually, the bill comes due. If you can't pay it back because nobody on your team understands the system, your project is bankrupt.
3. **The Sovereignty of Logic**: Even if you never type a line of syntax, you must remain the sovereign of the logic. This requires a level of domain expertise that "vibe-coding" alone cannot provide. You need to know where the agents are likely to hallucinate, which architectural tradeoffs matter for scale, and how to verify that the system isn't just "working" but is actually *correct*.

We are entering an era of the "Architect-Engineer." The goal isn't to stop looking at the code; it’s to look at the code more efficiently. Agents are an extension of our agency, not a replacement for our responsibility. If you want to use the polecats and the weasels to build your next product, by all means, let them loose. But remember: if you don't own the logic, the agents own you.
