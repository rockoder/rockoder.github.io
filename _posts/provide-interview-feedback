In my 15+ years of career, I have been on either side of the technical interview process for 100s of times. And one of the unsaid rule of the game is to not give feedback to the candidate on how they performed. Especially when the outcome is unfavorable to the candidate. And there are some legitimate reasons for that which I will not go into this post.
(1. You do know how the candidate would react. We do not want to down their moral or their confidence. 
2. We also do not want to end up being in a position to extensively justify our judgement and the interview process.
3. Finally we do not want to open possiblility to hear counterarguments )

There are some very strong arguments why you should share a comprehensive summary of how the candidate did in your interview.

1. It makes applying for the job very attractive

As a candidate, if I see two job openings in two different companies, keeping all this equal, I will apply first to the company that will give me feedback on how I did in the interview. This works very well for the company. You get to interview the candidates in the job market first without making any changes in the compensation or job perks. So effectively you will get more good candidates to interview.

2. Interviwers are more responsible

3. More transparency will help improve your interviewing process

4. You might get some good feedback on how to improve the process

5. Its not a big investment considering the return

You already have all the feedback collected from each interviewer. You already have gathered together and summaried why you don't want to hire the candidate. Why not complete the final step: Put this highlights and the lowlights from the interviews in a small write up and send it to the candidate. Write it down will also force the interviewers to think hard and objectively phrase why they are rejecting the candidate.
