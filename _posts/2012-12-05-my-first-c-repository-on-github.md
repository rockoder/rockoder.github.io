Finally I managed to make my first repository on GitHub!  

Since auto_ptr is broken in VS 2005, I had to write my own implementation of auto_ptr which was a quick (and dirty) fix for one of my project. For more details please refer:  
[https://github.com/rockoder/auto_ptr-for-VS-2005](https://github.com/rockoder/auto_ptr-for-VS-2005).

Shall upload few examples soon.
