My name is Ganesh Pagade.

I'm a software architect living in Bangalore, India.  
I'm on the engineering team at [Hewlett Packard Enterprise](http://www.hpe.com/).  
I've studied at [ISSC](http://issc.unipune.ac.in/).  
I've taught graduate and post graduate computer science courses.  
I've worked as a freelance software developer.  

Besides trying to understand the spirit that lives in the computer, I enjoy reading about working of human brain.

rockoder - I did some online freelance coding while in college. This is the account name you come up with when listening too much music and writing too much code. Pronounced as rock coder.
