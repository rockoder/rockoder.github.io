# Boring Advice
(change title - this is mainly about misunderstood advice or the right advice for the wrong reasons)

Some advice are so frequently given and delivered in such a generic way that they have lots all its effect.

Sometime one has to experience or see the advice in practice before understanding the full impact of it.

Below are few such advices, which at first did not register to me.

## 1. Say No More Often

(The ultimate form of optimization is elimination. - https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1286773557398319105)

It's not just about not having to do things you don't want to do. It's not about not allowing others or social pressure to get into doing things.

It is about focus. But even before that it is about clarity. Do you know what you want to do? Do you know the priority of all the things that you want to do? Where does this new thing stand in that list of things that you want to do?

Do you have such a list? If you do not know what you want to do, how will you say no to something?

And that is where the first power of say no lies.

And then comes the focus. Saying no allows you to focus on things that are important to you. You have limited time and energy. At some point in the day you will be worn out and cannot concentrate anymore. Can you work on the most inmportant thing before you reach this state?

Elimination is the best optimization. Say no will give you peace of mind. It will help you close that browser tab you have kept open for weeks to read an article which is not your priority right now.

## 2. Start writing

This is another advice you will hear often.

It is not about increasing your readership or your reach.

Gives clarity to your thoughts. Organizes your thoughts

Writing give you ability to time travel. You can go back in time and meet your younger self. Under that persona thought process and circumstances in which the things were written.

## 3. Exercise??

## 4. Mediation??
